      "C++ is a general purpose programming language that is used by millions of developers. It offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages don’t have. You can use C++ to write different kinds of applications for a variety of platforms. In this course, I’ll cover basics of language syntax – declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions – and work up to templates, pointers, const, and polymorphism. I’ll be using the principles of “modern C++” as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management. Some people are scared of C++, but I’ll show you how to approach the language without fear.\n",

      "Welcome to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory, and I'd like to introduce myself by telling people I've been using C++ since before Microsoft had a C++ compiler. That's well over 20 years, and, in that time, I've seen a lot of changes to the language and to how people use it. You know if you did a course in college 10 or 20 years where you know somebody who did, and they told you about it, you might not recognize the C++ I'm going to show you. I'm going to teach you the basics you need to write good C++. It's the most popular general-purpose programming language ever and one that's still relevant and useful today. To get started in this module, I'm going to tell you some of the advantages of C++ and why so many developers are using it. You'll also see what C++ CLI is, what C++ OX is, and start to learn what Modern C++ is, and why it's the way to write C++ this century, and then you'll be ready to start writing some code.\n",

      "I'd like to start by giving you an overview of how the course as a whole comes together. We're going to start with context, why C++, what are all these words and terminologies, so that you kind of feel you know where you stand, and then get you set up with the tools that you need in order to follow along in the demos. Once that's taken care of, you can get into writing some simple applications that demonstrate the language basics. You know, like any programming language, C++ lets you declare and work with the variables, and it's an object-oriented language so you can make objects and define classes, and you can control the flow of your application, like have a loop, do things over and over, or check to see if a particular condition holds or not. The syntax there is just something that we have to cover in order to build larger applications together. One of the things that's a little unusual about C++ is the way it actually lets you extend the language to your own objects and classes, and so we have to talk a little bit more about operators than we normally would. Then we can start to talk about templates. This is really something that sets C++ apart from other languages, and it is also one of the cornerstones of C++. It makes your life simpler. It's not a complicated advanced feature. It's something that you need to know really from the beginning, and then we have to talk about Pointers. A lot of people of scared of pointers, because they were taught Pointers the old-school way. In Modern C++, the responsibility for memory management is not on the programmer. There's a powerful Standard Library to help you perform common tasks, so it's all about power, but not about danger, and understanding Pointers in that context gets you positioned to really take advantage of what Modern C++ has to offer.\n",

      "title: Why C++?\n",
      "nline: 60\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "You've probably decided to give C++ a chance. After all, you're willing to start going through this material with me. But maybe you're still not a 100% sure that you want to learn it, or maybe even when you know it, you're not sure if it's the right thing to use for the particular project that you're taking on. C++ is a general-purpose language. It means you can use it for large, big metal applications that are doing number crunching, you know, simulating the weather on the entire world or controlling complicated real-time equipment. You can use it for a web service. You can use it for a client-based application that runs on your Windows' machine, and shows people screens, and asks them questions, and puts the answers in the database. You can use it for a tiny, little hand-held device of some kind, maybe a phone, maybe something tablet-y, whatever. Much, much smaller memory space, much, much smaller hard drive than that big iron-crunching, but the same programming language the whole way. So across a variety of platforms and across a variety of problem sets, C++ is a language that's well tuned to all of those. If you think of some other popular languages, maybe some other languages you know, often people will describe them and say, \"Well that's a great language for writing a web application. \"That's a great language for writing a text-processing application. \"That's a great language for numerical number crunching.\" Terrific. C++ is a great language for all of those things and one that you can leverage your knowledge of across a variety of different kinds of projects. C++ is about speed, about power, about performance. Where decisions are being made back in the language design level, very often the question is, \"Which way would be faster at run time?\" and that's the way it got done. Another real popular question is, \"Which gives the programmer the most control?\" A lot of decisions are left up to the programmer in the language in order that you can take the way that's faster in your particular case. You know, whenever you talk about performance, the answer is often, \"It depends,\" and when a language makes a single choice, then the developer can't adapt to the circumstances they find themselves in. In C++, because there's tremendous fine-grain control over what happens, you can choose the approach that makes your application perform as powerfully as possible, and C++ is a very popular language. Microsoft's Visual C++ team went out to do some numbers. Who's still using Native C++? And they discovered, Wow, a lot of people are using Native C++. They went to a number of open-source repositories and just ran the numbers. How many projects are written in each language? To their, I've got to say, to their tremendous surprise, the number one language was C++, and not just from Windows' projects, but across a variety of platforms. And for college students, that's the language college students are using. Not just for their assignments, but also for their personal projects. And when you have a ten-million developer base as C++ does, you have a lot of great libraries out there. Libraries that provide general-purpose algorithms, containers, what-not, helpful things, and specialized libraries that are all about image processing, or internet transmission, or things that you and I have never even heard of, but someone's gone and written an open-source C++ library that you can use to make that work simpler. Leveraging other people's work is obviously another great path to power and performance, because that's code that you didn't have to write. People talk a lot about how C++ is the language for speed, and it is, but that doesn't mean it's the language for just a small, select group of people. It's an incredibly popular general-purpose language and investing the time in learning it for one context may often bring you benefits in another context, and that's why I think it's worth learning.\n",

      "nline: 61\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "There's just one problem when you're talking about \"Why C++?\", and that's the other side of the question, \"Why not C++?\" It's all power, performance, control. It's popular. It's general purpose. Why isn't everybody using it? Well, you know you may have heard that it's hard. Mmm…I got to kind of disagree. Modern C++ is really not hard. What's probably got you nervous about C++ is that someone else has told you, or that you remember from a long time ago, are things that really aren't in Modern C++. So the first thing about Modern C++ is using the Standard Library. The Standard Library has a string class in it. The Standard Library has great collections and smart pointers that take care of memory management, like you do not have to delete memory that you allocated with NuGet. And it has File IO, Screen IO, and far too much to list. The same way if you've done .NET programming, it comes with a library of bits and pieces. You've done Java programming; it comes with a library of bits of pieces, and C++ comes with a library of bits of pieces, called the Standard Library. This isn't something that you get around to later once you're good at it. This is something you do from the beginning, using these out-of-the-box capabilities for your string manipulations for your collections to spare you the trouble of memory management, or pointer arithmetic, or a lot of the stuff that people kind of get afraid of. Modern C++ is powerful, but it's still readable, and it's not dangerous. Managing memory yourself, that's last century C++. That is not what we're going to be doing. It's not what is expected of people who are writing ordinary C++ application. A little bit different if you're writing a library, you just want to write an application. You're not going to manage memory, and that means you're not going get all caught-up in a lot of the dangers of managing your own memory, pointer arithmetic, those kinds of things. In fact, when I show Modern C++ to people who know C# or to people who know Java, what they tend to say with a tremendous amount of surprise is, \"Hey, I can read that!\" and they're not expecting it. We've all heard the joke, or at least those of us who work in C++ have heard the joke, it's like a bunch of comic book characters swearing at each other, and we do have a lot of different pieces of punctuation in C++, and they serve purposes, rather than just using dot for everything. But when you look at Modern C++, you'll be able to read it, if you know C# or Java. What's cool is how much faster it is. Let me just give you one example. Java and C# both have generics, the idea that you have a list of some things or a queue of some things, and C++ has them, too. C++ has templates. Now generics are resolved at run time. That means every time your application runs, some number of cycles are going to be spent figuring out, you know, what type do I use? What method do I call? What's going on here? Templates in C++ are resolved at compile time. That means those cycles are not spent at run time. The application's just plain faster, as a result, and those kind of advantages keep showing up when you're working in C++. That's why it's the first choice for speed of execution. So if it's readable, it's not complicated, doesn't have to be hard, and is just flat out faster. Now you're starting to see why C++ is such a popular language.\n",

      "nline: 47\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "So at least for a moment, bear with me that you agree that C++ is a great language to learn and a great language to use, because it is so general purpose in cross platform and powerful in performance, and that although you've heard it's hard, you're prepared to believe that Modern C++ is maybe not hard. Now if you already know C# or Java or some other language featuring brace brackets and semicolons, you may feel like, \"Okay, I can do this. \"I'm going to learn this hard thing,\" even though I've told you it's not real hard. But, surely, someone who doesn't know a programming language already should never start with something as terrifying as C++. Well, I disagree. I think C++ is a fine first language. When I started to learn to program, we had less languages to choose from. But even 20 years ago when I had been doing C++ for while, it was still a really popular first programming language. Generations of people learned C++ and got out in the world and turned into decent programmers, whether they ended up working long-term in C++ or not. It's certainly true that compared to the kind of C++ that was being taught 20 years ago, C# and Java are way easier. But you know, that's like comparing a car to like a wood-fired steam engine or something, and thinking that that's saying anything about cars versus trains. Modern C++ is not too hard for beginners. Many of the things that used to have to be done right at the beginning around memory management, and pointer arithmetic, and doing a whole lot of stuff by hand, that's just not part of Modern C++. You have a library that helps you, the same as those other languages have libraries that help you, and you have some very powerful constricts to keep you safe while you're having high-performance application. So even if you don't know another programming language, why not get started with C++? Now in this material, I'm not going to be covering basic programming concepts, like what is a loop and why are things sometimes true and sometimes false, but you don't need to feel that, \"Oh, I can't learn C++ because I don't know some other language.\" It's fine if this is the first language that you take on. If you do happen to know C# or Java, then you're going to learn C++ pretty quickly, because you're going to recognize a lot and say, \"Oh, that's just like what already knew!\" Now there are some things that are different, so don't get too overconfident. If you know old school C++, if you're one of those people who says, \"Well, you what? \"I've worked with this 10 years ago and now I have to come back to it,\" you may actually have a tougher time, because you're going to have to unlearn some things that were beaten into you that you really don't need to worry about so much anymore and you can lax a little and trust a little, and I will show you how it's really all going to be okay. If you don't know any programming languages yet, welcome aboard. You're going to have to look a little elsewhere for sort of concepts of programming languages, but you don't need to already know C or C# or Java in order to grasp the concept of C++. You can learn it as your first language.\n",

      "nline: 40\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "I'd like to clear up a little nomenclature before we dig into the actual heavy-duty details of syntax, and library, and all of that. You may have heard of C++/CLI, and to be honest, people sometimes mis-abbreviate this or they put dots in there. If you've heard C++ and CL something together, this is probably what they were trying to remember. You know, there are a number of languages that are sort of based on C++. After all, there's this huge pool of developers that already know the syntax, so you say, \"My language has the same syntax as C++, except for this one little thing,\" and very often, these variants will work with libraries that already out there and with tools that are already out there, maybe with a little bit of extension or modification. And this is a powerful way to bring new capabilities to that pool of C++ developers. And C++/CLI is one of those variants, and it makes managed code. So once upon a time, you know, before there was a .NET framework, before there was Java, there was C++, and it compiled to machine code on the machine that you were building on. Nowadays, we call that native code, because we need to distinguish that native code that actually runs directly on the metal from code that runs against some kind of a run time, whether it's a Java run time, or C#.NET framework run time, or you're writing in DB.NET and running against the .NET frameworks run time. Normal ordinary C++ produces native code, and Microsoft has compilers that come in Visual Studio that make native code. But it also has a set of tools inside Visual Studio that can make managed code from C++ source code. Managed code that can be easily called from C#, or DB, or any other kind of managed code you have kicking around. It does this with some extensions to the language itself, so it's not C++, it's C++/CLI, because it's a little different, has a few extra key words in it, a few extra pieces of punctuation. And this is a fantastic way to take a native library that was maybe written a long time ago, and wrap it up, put a wrapper around it to make it easy to call from .NET code. I'm not going to cover C++/CLI at all. If you learn C++, then you basically know C++/CLI, as well. You just need to learn the few extra little pieces of punctuation and key words, and you're good to go, and you'll be in a position to write those wrappers. But we are not going to have any C++/CLI content. We're all about native code.\n",

      "Something else you may have heard or read is C++0x. In order to understand what that is, we need to sort of back up a little bit to who owns C++. The answer is kind of nobody. No one person sat down and invented it. Bjarne, the father of C++, and a number of different compiler venders make C++ compilers, but the owners of those compilers can't arbitrarily decide to change the language. So, take a language like Visual Basic, which eventually became Visual Basic .NET, that's just a language that Microsoft developed and owns, and if they want to add a key word to it, they just add a key word to it. C++ isn't like that. It's got a standard that says, \"Here are the key words in this language,\" and the standard library that I mentioned is part of the standard. So there's a standards committee, and they get together and decide whether or not to add a key word or a piece of punctuation. They decide whether or not to add some capabilities to the library. The current version, before C++0x, was technically C++03, but most people called it C++98, because 03 was just a little kind of tweaky update. And to be honest, most people just called it C++ and didn't have any idea what the year was from. Back when the 03 version finished, there were people saying, \"Okay, let's get going on the next one. \"It's going to be 0 something; we don't know what. \"It'll be some time before 2009,\" and right away, the joke was, \"Boy, \"I hope X doesn't need to be a hexadecimal digit!\" now which, of course, it did. Eventually, it'll probably be ll or 12. It's pretty much done now, has to go through some hoops, and it'll end up being C++11 or C++12. Of course, we'll just call it C++. There's some new functionality added, some new key words, some new punctuation, and a lot of very cool stuff in the library, and we'll just use it, and we won't really remember a time when that wasn't there. You know, I remember a time when certain key words weren't in C++, but I don't go around saying, \"Oh, hmm…oh, you're using that key word. \"Gees, that was only added in 1998. \"That's very modern of you,\" and it'll be the same with these C++0x key words. They'll just be normal. They'll just be what C++ had in them. Now the standards committee is an interesting mix of people from compiler vendors; people who just care about the language; people who use the language a lot; people from academia; and so on. And the compiler vendors, it's all been a completely open and transparent process. When they could see, yes, we all agree on this, and no matter how long the whole standard gets to put together, one particular aspect is going to be adopted for sure and started to put that capability into the compilers. So Visual Studio 2010, which has already been released, supports all of the library changes in C++0x, and almost all of the language changes. So if you're using Visual Studio 2010, including the Express Edition, you can just work with C++0x features that I'm going to show you in this course, and never particularly know whether they're added just now or whether they're from ten years ago, or twenty years ago, or whatever. Just to be on the safe side, when I show you something that's from C++0x, I will point it out so that if you have some C++ experience from the past, you say, \"Wait, I don't think that's a key word,\" you'll get a little bit of a reminder that's it's a new key word, so that you don't feel that something strange is happened when you weren't looking.\n",

That's what it's all about. Sure, you may have heard that it's a difficult language, but it doesn't have to be, especially, if you write Modern C++. It's clean. It's simple, and it lets the Standard Library do a lot of the work. Things that you think are too different to do by hand, you probably don't have to do by hand. Things that you think are hard to read if you do it 1990 C++ way, don't have to be hard to read at all, if you do it the Modern C++ way.

      "In this course, I am going to teach you to how to write C++ applications using Visual Studio exclusively. Visual Studio is what's called an Integrated Development Environment. It has an editor where you can type your code, a compiler that transforms the code you typed into something that can be executed, and a debugger that helps you observe it executing and learn where you may have a problem and fix that problem, and a whole pile of other related tools as well. Now, there are other ways to compile your applications, you can get standalone compilers, Microsoft has a number of free ones that it distributes as part of its SDK, and other people make and either give away or sell C++ compilers. But Visual Studio is more than just a compiler, and you won't be typing a lot of commands at the command line and learning some strange syntax in order to pull your projects and applications together if you use Visual Studio. Specifically, I am going to use Visual Studio Express, which is one of many different additions of Visual Studio. Now Express is not a single thing, there is Visual C++ Express, Visual C# Express, and so on, as a version for Visual Basic for web development, for phone development and Express is completely and totally free. It's free, even if you use it to make applications that you sell for money, that is all fine. There is a little functionality in some of the other additions of Vision Studio, that is not in Express. I won't be showing any of that functionality in this material, so to follow along in these demos you can just get Express and use it. And should the time come when you find, oh I do need something that's in Professional, which costs roughly around $1,000, a little bit less maybe. And then maybe you discover, oh there is something that I need that's in Premium, which costs about five times as much as professional or wow, I love this feature in Ultimate and I am willing to pay double what Premium costs to get Ultimate. That's fine, that's your choice, but in order to follow along in this material, you do not need to go out and get one of those versions of Visual Studio. Now if you happen to own a version of Visual Studio, perhaps because you work in another language and you are considering adding C++ to your arsenal, you can of course follow along in all of the demos I am going to show you, using your copy of Visual Studio. Things may look a little different, because Express is a simpler, stripped down UI with less menus and less options, so my screens may look a little simpler than your screens, but all the code that works in Express will work in other editions of Visual Studio. So that's not going to be a problem at all.\n",

And there is a web based installer that runs relatively quickly, downloads about 70 MB, starts to run and then installs Express on your machine. And Visual C++ Express will coexist with Visual Studio 2010 if you have it installed as I do, but if you have Visual Studio 2010 installed, go right ahead and use that, you don't need to download Express, just follow along with what we're doing.\n",

      "Once you have Visual C++ Express installed, you need to learn how to use it. I am going to show you around it using some code that is already written and that I know runs. This is the Visual C++ Express product, and there are a lot of, kind of moving parts here that I want to show you. First, this large or at least largest of them all window, is the sort of main editor pane where you edit your code. And then there are various tool windows that each have their name, like this one is the output window, and you can close them with the X, or just unpin them with this pin so that they are down here on a little pane and you can click them to make them come back up, or close them completely. This sort of standard configuration, here's the editor and here's my Solution Explorer, is what most people have open when they're working on a C++ application. Now if you are using a product other than Visual C++ Express, if you are using some other copy of Visual Studio that you had around, your Solution Explorer may not be on the left like this, it may be over here on the right. If you want, you can change your settings in that other application to C++ settings, and then it will look more like this. Or you can just kind of map between the two as you follow along. Now there are less menus and tool bars in the Express additions of Visual Studio than in the Pro, Premium, and Ultimate versions, but there's still plenty of menu items. And I am not going to walk through all of these and explain them all in turn, I will just show you how to do some things, and you will start to get comfortable with the menus and with the tool bar options as we go. So what I have here in the editor window, is a very, very simple C++ application. No doubt you have heard of the concept of saying hello world as your first application, this is slightly more sophisticated. It will actually say hello to whoever introduces themselves to it. And I am going to, before I show you any of the code, simply run it so that you can see how it works. And in order to run it, I need to use a command that's actually not in the menus for Visual C++ Express, and that's the run without debugging command. You can see that there is a perhaps familiar green triangle here labeled Start Debugging (F5). I don't want to debug this application, I just want to run it, and that's Control+F5, so I am going to hold Control and press F5. And my application runs, this is a very large DOS prompt for this size of screen, let me just shrink it a little. So this DOS prompt or command box is what console applications run in, and it's put some letters on the screen, it says Type your name. If I type my name and press enter, it says Hello Kate, Press any key to continue. This is what we call a console application, and all of the IO is in the form of text, either text the program types to me, or texts that I type back to the program. So I am just going to press a key, and we have finished running the application and we are now back in Visual C++ Express. In a little while I am going to explain this code to you in slightly more detail. But I'd like to start by just kind of taking this as a given and showing you some of what Vision Studio can do for you before you have to start to learn what all of the different pieces of this code mean. Programs in C++ are made up of statements, and statements generally speaking, end with a semi-colon, just as they do in C# and Java and the other languages that we often call semi-colon brace bracket languages. So I would like to show you what happens if I take the semi-colon off the end of a line where it belongs. So for example here, if I delete this semi-colon, one thing that happens is that this margin color here becomes yellow. Green in the margin indicates a saved change and yellow indicates an unsaved change. So if I click the Save icon up here, it goes back to being green. The other lines are green because I edited them just before this demo started. But you may also notice that there is a little red underline here underneath this closed brace bracket. And if you hover over it, it actually says Error: expected a semi-colon, and this is a compiler error, happening in the editor before I have deliberately compiled my code. Let's say for a moment that I didn't spot that red wiggly, I didn't know what it meant, or I just didn't see it there and I'd like to try compiling my code. Compiling your application, takes your code and prepares it to be an executable. Technically speaking, in C++ we have a compile step and then a link step. Compiling is done once to each of your source files and then linking pulls them all together into an executable. We only have one source file in here, this Hello.cpp, so we will compile it and then immediately link it together. And that combination of compiling all of your source files and then linking the resulting objects into an executable, is known just as build the solution. So on the debug menu, there is this command to Build Solution and I can select this command. Now you see that at the last line of by build output says that one failed, 0 succeeded. I have a problem. Let's just pin this in place so that we can see. In this line of output is my error message. So if I scroll past the path to the file, I can see it's a syntax error missing semi-colon before brace bracket. Now it tells you what line the problem happened on, happened on line 16. And if I put my cursor on line 16, you can see down here that's line 15, column 10, for what that matters, and the actual problem is on the next line because we hit the brace bracket without adding a semi-colon in between. But that would be a very poor way to try to find your error messages and deal with them to look for line numbers and then go in here and move the cursor around until the line number looked right. All you need to do is just double-click the line with the error on it and you are taken directly to that line here in the editor. You also get the message repeated here, syntax error: missing semi-colon before brace bracket. So if I fix the mistake by putting the semi-colon back and build again, you can see that it succeeded. One succeeded, zero failed. I want to just keep making pretty much the same edit and carrying forward so that you can see some of the things that Vision Studio does for you automatically. If I edit away the semi-colon again, this time we have a little more time to look around and notice some other things. There's a star that shows up here on the name of this file. If you have many files open at once, one of them is sort of current at a time, and it is highlighted like this, but any with unsaved changes will have this star on them. And if you save them by clicking the Save button, then the changes will obviously be saved, the star will go away, the yellow will turn to green and so on. What a lot of people don't know, is that when you build with unsaved changes like this, it is saved for you automatically. So you saw the yellow turned green, the star went away, and it automatically saved our change as part of the build process. So you don't need to save and then build. If you are a really confident person or you've gotten used to looking for those red wiggly underlines and you know that when they are not there you are pretty much going to run successfully, you can just go straight to running without building first. So if I use Control+F5 to run the application, it says all of this is out of date, would you like to build it? And you can even say I want to always build it, don't show this again. Whether you say yes or no, then that will be your answer for all time. I am just going to say yes without ticking the box. So it saves everything, builds everything, and it is going to work and then it will immediately run and greet me. So at this point, you know how to edit code, you know how to build code, and you know how to run code without debugging. I just want to take a moment and show you why I have been running without debugging. If I just click the green triangle to start debugging, but I don't have any breakpoints or any places inside my code for it to stop, the application will just run and then terminate because it is finished. So I'll run it. I get a slightly smaller font here because my debug settings are a little different from my non-debug ones, but I'll enter my name. And it's gone, and you are like, where did my app go? I didn't get to see my output. Well because it just finished, you didn't have any breakpoints. So there are some ways to get around this, like putting a breakpoint in your application for no other reason than to give you a chance to read the output. Or putting a statement in your code that causes it to stop and wait. The way I deal with this is I just use Control+F5, and then you automatically get that press any key to continue. That's what works for me and that's what I am going to be doing in the demos for you.\n",

      "C++ is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to write a wide variety of different applications. So you could create a Windows application, that's something with, you know buttons and text boxes and drop downs, the kinds of controls that you are maybe used to interacting with in a Windows application. It can also be used to write console applications, which is what I just showed you in the demonstration. They write text to the screen, they read text from the screen. Interesting thing about a console application in contrast to a Windows application is that they only sort of listen to you typing on the keyboard when they decide they want to. So, it says enter your name and then it is sitting there listening and waiting for you to type your name. At other times you can type all you like and the application would not be listening and would not react to that. Whereas in a Windows application, very often you can type anytime, anywhere without waiting to be prompted. You can press F keys, you can click things with the mouse and the application is going to kind of react to that. You can also build in C++ services and servers, things that don't even have a user interface at all, they just kind of run on the machine and they react to requests coming in, typically from other applications or to things happening on the computer. And you can write libraries, which is basically reusable code for other applications to leverage. The console applications are the simplest for us to deal with because there're really just working with text. Text to the screen, text from the keyboard. They don't have to show how to draw lines, circles, squares, how to build controls, how to interact with Windows, how to react to being interrupted by user input at any time. We can focus on just the syntax of the language. Where does the semi-colon go? What is the name of this piece of the language and why does it look like that? Without having to learn how Windows works or the rules for how to draw really great three dimensional graphics with a glow and transparency and so on. Those are the applications that we're going to be working with, just as ways of demonstrating the language. Console applications are all about text and usually very very simple calculations, so that you can focus on what you need to learn about syntax, punctuation, and some of the other things that may be new to you.\n",

      "You are going to write console applications because they are simple, but our very simple hello world application had quite a few lines of code and I would like to actually go through them now and explain them to you in turn. It started with a comment. Comments in C++, when they are on a line of their own like this one, start with the two slashes. And this comment was actually generated by the Visual Studio Wizard that made the project, and you'll see a little bit more about that shortly. Any line that starts slash, slash you can ignore it, it's a comment. Then we had these three, what are called pre-processor directives. C++ has something called a pre-processor, which goes through your code before the compiler and tweaks it a little bit. And one of things that it does, is it combines multiple files into one. If there is some functionality that you use routinely, you put just the definitions of that functionality in what's known as a header file. And include that header in each file that needs it. Often when people first meet this, they think it doesn't make any sense and doesn't have any value, because they're seeing very small applications where everything could fit in a single file. But it can be very useful for larger structured applications that have perhaps hundreds of functions that need to be used by some parts of the applications, but not others. And you can use header files to keep this all straight and to make it all make sense. The symbol at the beginning of these lines is pronounced differently by different people. You might hear hash, you might hear pound, you might hear number sign or just number. What I hear the most often is nothing at all. People will just read these lines as include standard afh.x, include iostream, include string, they don't even pronounce the symbol. You may notice that the first line has double quotes around the file name and the other two lines have angle brackets. As well, the first line has a .h and the other two lines do not. This is deliberate and it actually makes sense. The double quoted line is referring to a file that is part of the solution we are compiling and I will show you that in a little while in the demo. The angle bracket lines are referring to parts of the standard library. Functionality that comes with C++. As a cross platform language, and something that is controlled by a standards committee, there was an interesting dilemma to be solved when these headers were being named. It's very common in Windows to say .h for your header file. But, some people who have a C background and were using .h for C header files, liked to use HPP for C++ header files, just as we use CPP for the source file of a C++ program. Rather than settle the issue of whether they should be called something .h or something .hpp, the standards committee made the standard library includes not have any extension at all. So it is just iostream or just string. You may find some really old code if you have an old book that uses extensions on their standards library headers. Do not pay attention to that book, it is too old. It's been very much the case for a long time, that there is no extension on a header include. So these three lines include one header from elsewhere in our project, pronounced standard afx.h. You pretty much always pronounce STD as standard in C++ land and two headers from the library, one called iostream and one called string. And between them, these headers provide some of the definitions that the rest of the application is going to use. This line declares the main, the entry point, the thing that is run when you run the application. So when you run this application by choosing Control+F5, Windows does some loading, does some bits and pieces and then hands control to the start of this function. You may read again elsewhere that your program is always called main, this tmain actually gets translated by the pre-processor into main. It's kind of a long story. This is what the Wizard will generate for you and this is what is right when you are working in Visual Studio. Then we have a brace bracket. That says here tmain starts and everything that follows is in that tmain until we hit the close brace bracket that ends it. This is the line of code that caused \"Type your name\" to appear in that black DOS box or command prompt when the application ran. The way you read this is standard c out. The symbol in between them, which you get by typing a colon twice on your keyboard, is known as the scope resolution operator. The scope resolution operator shows up in a couple places, but one of the really important ones is between a name space name and something that's in the name space. And c out is in the standard name space. Specifically, c out stands for Consult Output, so I am using a standard capability that comes with the language to put output on the console. Not surprisingly, after a little bit of punctuation that I will explain later, you see \"Type your name\" and type your name is what we saw appear on console output. Then we have again the symbol that I'll explain later and standard endl, which everyone I know pronounces end line, because that it what it stands for. And that's what caused the cursor to move down to the next line for me to type my name on it. And then there's a semi-colon, because our lines end with a semi-colon. Pre-processor directives like the includes didn't end with a semi-colon, and the function definition didn't end with a semi-colon. Braces are all on their own. But this is our first kind of real line of the application, so it is ending with a semi-colon. This line declares a variable. As in a lot of languages, we say the type of the variable and then one or more spaces and then the name we want to give it, and then in this case we end the statement with a semi-colon. So the type of this variable is std::string, which is generally pronounced standard string or some people might say stood string. We're using the string class from that standard library and we are giving the name of this object, name. It's a little self-referential, but it asked the person for their name so, calling it name makes perfect sense. So name is a string. You don't know all of what a string can do. You don't need to know all of what a string can do. It can certainly hold strings, and that's what we are going to ask it to do. This line is using std::cin for Console Input, another thing in the standard name space that comes with the standard library. Now, I am still not discussing the punctuation, but I will just point out that these point in the opposite direction than they did back when we were using c out. And if this makes you think of something going from console input into name, that's exactly how you are supposed to think of it. So this line of code takes whatever it was that I typed on the keyboard, and puts it in the string that is being referred to as name. Now we are back to our friend console output and we are putting out Hello, space and then whatever is in the string name and then another standard end line. And that's why it came back and said Hello Kate to me when it ran. There's no code in this program to pause when we get to the end. As you saw when we ran the debugger, we didn't pause when we got to the end. The only reason it pauses when you get to the end when you run with Control+F5, is because Visual Studio provides that capability for you, so there is no code in the program to pause. The next line in the program is to return. Now when you return from main you are completely done. You're telling Windows that your application is terminated and it's time to close up the window if that's what the window was launched for. You may notice that tmain starts int _ tmain and int is the return type of that function. Just as string was the type of name. Some people wonder why a function like main would bother to return a value or what it could mean. Especially in the days of DOS, we actually did used to use the return values of applications to indicate whether they succeeded or not for example. It's unusual to see anybody deliberately put a value in the return type of a console application these days, but you can't leave it out. So we just type return 0, and they all return 0 and it all works fine. If you care, 0 actually means success, so you are saying that we succeeded, which I think is fair. Someone typed their name, we said hello to them, we accomplished our mission and we can return. So the last line of the application is the close brace to indicate the end of tmain. This really is just to keep the compiler happy. When the program is executing, we'll return, but if you left that close brace off, the compiler would say, I don't know where tmain ends, something has gone wrong here, so you have to include it. And that's the structure of our very simplest console application. You can see that we have comments, we're including header files, we are defining our main function, which is what Windows will launch for us when we run the application. We are putting something on standard output using the console output capability of the standard library. We are working with string from the standard library and we are getting information from console input, again using part of the standard library. If you wanted to take this application and put it on a completely different operating system, and use a completely different compiler, you would probably have to change the name from tmain to say just main, but it would run properly and work on those compilers and on those operating systems as well. That's the big appeal of C++. There is probably more punctuation on the screen than you are used to seeing, but when we walk through it a line at a time, it shouldn't be too intimidating, and it becomes second nature very quickly. Now that you've seen it a line at a time, it may also be a little bit more readable if we now go back over and take a look at the syntax coloring in Visual C++ Express. You can see that the comments are green. The include directives are blue and the particular file that they are including is red. You can see that this int and this return are also blue and these other types are black, they are sort of the meat and potatoes of your application. The strings are in red, it helps to make them stand out. This very simple application, contains the structure that every console application contains, and once you can read this and write this, you are reading and writing C++.\n",

      "Parts of this starter application were created by Visual Studio itself. I didn't have to type all of this in. So, let me show you how to create a new application using Visual C++ Express. When you open visual C++ Express, most of the time it is going to look like this. This is called the Start Page. Now there may not be a start page when you open it if somebody unchecked this box here that says, Show page on startup. If that's the case, you can always get it back on the view menu, choose Start Page. In older versions of Visual Studio, a lot of people checked this box, Show page on startup, because the start page serves no purpose once you've started. It just uses up a tab and gets in the way. That's why I love this tick, Close page after project load. This lets me have a startup page every time I launch Visual Studio, but it doesn't bother me because as soon as I open an existing project, it goes away. And speaking of opening existing projects, here under Recent Projects, it lists out my recent projects. So the Hello project that I used in a previous demo is listed here, and it is a single click to open that up and start working on it, but I want to show you how to make a new one. So I am going to click New Project. Because this is Visual C++ Express, it is only offering me C++ applications. If you are using another version of Visual Studio, it may be offering you Visual Basic, or C# or any other number of languages and that's fine. Make sure that you find the C++. And there are several different kinds of applications, and there are two different kinds with console in their name, CLR Console Application and Win32 Console Application. And it's important not to get them confused. The CLR Console Application, has a rather unhelpful description. A project for creating a console application, you are like woo-hoo that must be what I want right? No. What you want is a Win32 Console Application. The difference is that a CLR Console Application is that C++/CLI, it runs under the .NET framework. So yes it is a console application, but it is not just C++, it has those extensions in it to make it C++/CLI. It makes managed code, that's not what we are doing. So we want the Win32 Console Application. Win32 Project makes a Windows application. A Windows Forms Application makes a managed Windows application, we definitely don't want those. Makefile Project is appropriate if you are coming over from another compiler, probably from another platform and you want to use something called a makefile to control the way your project builds. We are not going to go there. Empty Project is what is sounds like, you have to add things to it. CLR Empty Project, same deal, but slightly different settings. And then finally Class Library, it mentions you can write libraries in C++ for reusable code that's used by many other different applications. It's a useful thing, but it is not what we are making today. So we want to use a Win32 Console Application. And, you can give it whatever name you like, say FirstApp. And put it wherever you like. By default, Visual Studio likes to put things in your documents under Visual Studio 2010 Projects. And if that's where you are happy to have them, then that could be where they are. I have a different place for mine, it doesn't really matter. I am just going to click OK. And in some languages, you make a new project, you get a new project, but in C++ you get a Wizard. It doesn't have very many steps. In fact, it really only has two steps and the first one doesn't do anything, but you have a Wizard. If without seeing the settings you are great because you just know what the settings are, you could click Finish right now. Let's say we are not going to, let's click Next. Now you may have noticed a slight sort of change in the font situation on this side. It turns out, this is an index into the steps of the Wizard. So if I click Previous, you can see one is a link and one is not. And that's our two steps of our Wizard. So I could also get through it by clicking this, or by using the Next and Previous. Now the questions that it's asking here, are questions it already knows the answers to. Do you want a Windows app, a console app, a DLL or a library? Well I already said I wanted a console app. Do you actually want nothing at all, you can take Empty project and you are probably thinking, well if I wanted Empty project wouldn't I have chosen an Empty project? I know, I didn't write this Wizard, this is just what it is. This pre-compiled header, I am going to suggest that you leave ticked, even though you don't really know what it really means. It is something that makes your application compile faster. It doesn't make it run faster, but it can make it compile faster and it's therefore a good habit. You won't be able to take full advantage of it for a while yet, but if you just get in the habit of leaving that ticked, it won't hurt you. And then over here we have some things that are grayed out. And the reason they are grayed out is that this dialog is shared by different versions of Visual Studio and in some of the other versions, you have options to add common header files for ATL and MFC. Express doesn't support ATL or MFC, so those options are grayed out. So it turns out you really have nothing to do on this step of the Wizard, except click Finish, but you need to look at it before you can do that. So the Wizard runs and you can see that it generates some of the things that you saw in the sample app I showed you. The comment, saying the name of the file, and Defines the entry point for the application, the include of stdafx.h, and that's actually there because you ticked the pre-compile headers box, the tmain, and the return 0. So you would put your own code in here to do whatever it is you wanted your application to do. I haven't really talked about Solution Explorer up until now, but this is a good time to explain a little bit. Solution Explorer is showing you all of the files in your project and in your solution. The sort of unit of work in Visual Studio is a solution. And a solution contains one or more projects, and a project is in a single language, it contains one or more files, and you build a project at a time. If there are multiple projects in a solution, you can build them independently, or build the whole solution at once. And one of the projects typically produces an executable that you can actually run. So, when you right-click on the solution, one of your choices is to build the solution. When you right-click on the project, you have a build that would just build the project, Project Only, Build Only FirstApp, and so on. Here we have only one project in our solution, so there is not much of a distinction between the whole solution and the single project, but that's how it is organized in here. And then you have your files and Solution Explorer categorizes your Header Files separately from your Source Files. It's just a convenience. They are not actually arranged this way on your hard drive. So, if I come up here to this tab, and one thing a lot of people don't know is that if you pause it will tell you the path to the file. I can right-click the tab and chose Open Containing Folder. And these are the actual files on my machine that have been created as part of creating this project. Now you will see that they are not split up into folders about headers and source and so on. The .h files and .cpp files are all in here together. That's just the way that Solution Explorer shows them to you. And to open any other file in the editor, you just double-click it over here in Solution Explorer. This is ReadMe.txt, which explains what all the bits and pieces of the project are. And this is that stdafx.h. Standard afx.h is your pre-compiled headers. Basically, things that you use a lot in many different places, you can put in here and it will speed up the compilation process. This poor little application doesn't use anything, never mind using something a lot in a lot of different files. So we don't have anything extra in standard afx.h. Now that I have multiple files open in Visual Studio, you can see how they each have their own document tab across the top. You can switch between them just by clicking on the tabs, pretty straight forward. And you can close any one of them just by clicking its X. It doesn't have to be open for you to close it that way. I hope this helps you to see how Visual C++ Express works and how to work with it. The most important things you are going to do is typing code here in this editor, and running your applications and looking at the output and learning from what you see in the output. A little bit of moving around from file to file, and occasionally creating a new project, and you are ready to go in terms of using Visual C++ Express. Which means you are ready to go in terms of learning some syntax for C++.\n",

      "This module has been about getting you ready to start to learn the building blocks of any C++ application. So to start with, I would encourage you to go and get Visual C++ Express. If you have another version of Visual Studio, that's great, but Visual C++ Express is free and it will work fine for all of the demos that we are doing. And its relatively a straight forward application to use and to get comfortable and familiar with. Because it's an integrated development environment, you can edit your code. You can see those red wigglies when you make a mistake while you are editing your code. You can build as a combination of compiling and linking. It's not really terribly important at the moment to understand them. When you start to get errors, you need to be able to understand the difference between a compiler error and a linker error and we will talk about those as we go. And you see how to run an application without debugging or with debugging, and the possible problem when you are running a console application, that if you run without debugging, it just kind of runs out the end and you don't see the output. And how running without debugging causes, Visual Studio will pause it for you, give you a chance to read the output. That's generally what we are going to want to do. Because console applications are the simplest, that's what all the demos in this course are going to be, and that's what you are going to be using to get comfortable and familiar with the syntax of the language and the way that applications come together.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language C++. In this module, I'll begin a discussion of variables by talking about fundamental types and showing you how to work with variables of different types. One of my favorite sayings is the compiler is your friend and I'm going to show you how the complier can save you from mistakes that you might not have spotted yourself.\n",

      "lines: \n",
      "When you're working with variables in C++, one of things that's just an underpinning of the way the whole thing works is that every variable has a type and C++ is a strongly typed language. That means that the type doesn't change over the lifetime of the program. If x is an integer, it can hold integers and integers only, and something else will have to hold dates or strings, or other kinds of information. Before you can put a value into a variable you must declare it anywhere before you use it including even really right on you put a value into it and when you declare it specify its type and then that's it, that's its type. Why do I say the complier is your friend? Because in a strongly typed language you can't put a string into a variable that's expecting a number or number into a variable that's expecting a string and these kinds of errors where you forget to convert things are caught for you by the complier and it says wait, those things are compatible, what are you doing? Other times maybe it says you are throwing away some information. I'll do this but I'm going to have to make a conversion and you'll lose some precision and these warnings often cause you to realize --- I wasn't thinking, I didn't even want to put that value into that variable, so that's how the compiler can kind of save you from trouble. Now I'm talking first about fundamental types and by this I mean types that are built into the language. Things to hold numbers, true or false, and C++ also has a type called character that can be used to hold either a small number or a single character like the letter a. There are also user defined types in C++, defined by you personally or by some library that you're using. In fact, the very first Hello World demo that I showed in this material, we had a string to put someone's name into you could write your own string if you wanted to, not a lot of value in that, the one that comes with the standard library is very good, but you could write something that represented an employee, or a bank account, or an insurance policy, or a nuclear reactor if you liked, and those would be user defined types. User defined types in C++ can be either structs or classes. I'm going to talk about those a little later on, not in this module, but you'll see that they are first class citizens and they can do everything that the fundamental types can do. That's an important thing that sets C++ apart for some other languages. So when I'm telling you what can be done for fundamental types, remember that that same suite of possibilities is also there for types you define or types that are defined in a library that you're using.\n",

      "title: Fundamental Types\n",
      "nline: 27\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "The fundamental types can be categorized according to what they hold, what kind of information they hold. So there are a series of types for example that hold integers, numbers without a fractional part, like 3 or 702 and in C++ we have short, long, int, unsigned short, unsigned long, and unsigned int. Short and long as you can probably guess from their names, different lengths, they have a different number of bytes in them. An int is a convenient type that is actually chosen a length to be the most efficient on the machine where it's running. So if you really don't care about the length at all because you're just going to put a number in it like 3, int is a great choice. The unsigned versions can each hold a number twice as large as the signed versions because they don't use a bit for sign. We'll talk more about how many bytes a number can hold and what happens if you try to put overlarge numbers in, in a little while. You won't go wrong when you first start by just putting integers into variables of type ints. It's easy to remember, it's probably right, and unless you happen to be getting near the limit of the number that can fit into the bytes, you're going to be doing just fine and that's a very large number as you'll see shortly. Now, if your number has a fractional part, if it's a 7.2, 3.29, then that's a real number and you can use either float or a double and double has more capacity, can hold larger numbers, and more digits of precision than float can. Most of the time, just put things in doubles and your life will tick along as you expect. There's also a type called character and believe or not, C++ people argue about how to say the name of this type. Some people including me pronounce it char, but you will meet people who call it char. Take my advice and don't argue about how to pronounce variable types, if someone says char this is what they mean, if someone says char this is what they mean, you pronounce it however you want. There's even an unsigned char, which probably doesn't sound like it makes an sense, I means what's -a or for that matter, how is +y different from -y? Well, because char is a very small number of bytes, only 8 bytes, people sometimes use it to hold little numbers like 3 and they therefore want to be able to distinguish whether their putting say -3 in it or a positive number. So char and unsigned char can technically be used for numbers, but they can also be used to hold a single letter and finally we can round out our fundamental types with Boolean values true or false and they are of type bool. The only values that you can put into a bool are true or false, but there are ways to convert to that from other values and one thing you'll especially see when we get into operators is people converting back and forth from numbers to Boolean, but the only values a bool can hold are true or false.\n",

      "I have a demo to show you that will take these types out for a spin, show us putting some values back and forth into different types of variables, and what happens especially when you mix and match types and convert maybe from one type to another, So here in Visual C++ Express, I have a project called VariablesAndTypes and you see for example here we declare an integer called i1 and initialize it with a value of 1 and then I'm printing the values out onto the console output and that's why I have this include here of iostream so that I can use standard console output to write to. I declare another integer here and don't give if a value right away, but then give it a value on the next line, and there's really no important difference between these two, for integers. There can be a difference for your own user defined types, I'll talk about that in a little while and then this third way which some people ask about when the first time they see it. Actually initializing that integer using these round brackets and this is another way to do. It's simply a matter of taste. These three have no real difference. If I run this application with Ctrl+F5, let it compile and then I'll just pull this window down so that you can see the code, hopefully no one is terribly surprised that i1 comes out as 1, i2 as 2, and i3 as 3 because those are the values that I've initialized them to. If we scroll down a little further in the code, you can see we've got a couple of doubles here. I'm putting a real number into d1 2.2 and for d2 I'm assigning to the value that's in i1. So i1's an integer and the integers we say promoted to a double and there's no loss of any information, that's just fine. But this next line, we take another integer i4 and we assign it to this value that's in d1, which is 2.2. Now you can't put 2.2 into an integer, so we're going to lose some information. If you're expecting a runtime error from doing this, you don't get one. Let's take a look at the output obviously there's no error messages, d1 comes out as 2.2, d2 comes out as 1, which is what was in i1 and i4 comes out as 2, the value is just truncated silently it runtime with no complaints and if that was what you wanted, fantastic, if it wasn't there was a way to find out that you were going to have this problem, but it's not something you'll be told about at runtime. Let's carry down here. I have a character called c1 and you see that it's perfectly ordinary to put a value into a character using single quotes then the letter then end single quote. I have a line here that's currently commented out that uses double quotes, I'm going to let you see the error message from that in a moment, we'll print out c1 and not surprisingly it's a and then I have some Boolean values, I call it flag and I started as false, print that out. It actually prints out 0 when you send the Boolean value to c out. Then I take that and I assign it to i1, which you remember had the numerical value of 1 and sure enough it comes out as 1. It sounds like you can put a number into a bool so just to prove you can, I'm going to take this double number, d1, which has the value 2.2, put it into the flag and it still prints out 1 because really what flag is, is true and when you send true to console output, it happens to put a 1 on the screen, but its value is either true or false and the easiest way to see that is if I rerun the application under the debugger. So I'm going to Stop this run and just before you do the debugger run, I'll show you what would happen if I were to try to compile this line that's trying to initialize a character using double quotes rather than single quotes. To a lot of people from other programming languages, when they see \"b\", the think we'll that's a single character, but it's not. It's what a lot of people call c style string, it's actually an array of characters with a special termination character at the end of the array. So one real character the letter b and the special termination character. We're not using those kinds of strings because I think the standard strings are much easier to work with, but I just want you to know that you can't initialize a character using a string. So you can see there's red wiggles here and it says Error: a value of type \"const char*\" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type \"char\". The important part of that is probably the word error. When you want to initialize a character use only a single quote, a single quote for a single character, easy way to remember it. So let's comment that back out and this time I'm going to run the application under the debugger because I want to show you how the debugger displays Boolean values. Now this, exact ins and outs of how to debug an application are not what we're here for, so I'm just going to treat the debugger as a way to let you see values. The way to see values is to pause the program and you pause at what's called a break point. Lots of ways to get break points in your application. If you're not familiar with Visual Studio probably your best choice is to simply right click on a line, Breakpoint, Insert Breakpoint. Once you're a little bit more familiar, you'll recognize this gray margin as sort of the breakpoint margin and you can click on one to make it go away, or click on the empty margin to set one, but if you're not 100% which margins are which, right click to set your breakpoints. Now when I hit this, we will run just up until the breakpoint and then we'll stop. Now here, stopped at the breakpoint, you can see this window here called Autos. If for some reason you don't see this window when you're doing this yourself, you can go on the Debug menu, choose Windows, and bring up a particular window that you might want. Locals is a perfectly good substitute for Autos, it simply shows a few more values. Now you can see here that paused execution before we're running this line. The i1 value is just gibberish. In fact, what the debugger is showing is just what happened to used to be in that memory, we haven't yet declared the variable or put a value into it. So if I step over this line, using this Step Over button on the toolbar, now you can see down here that i1 has the value 1. Now none of this is terribly exciting because you watched all these in the console window and they probably weren't that exciting the first time through. So I'm just going to scroll down to here, right click, and choose Run To Cursor, just to whiz past all of that. Because what I actually think is worth seeing is the way the debugger displays our Boolean value of flag. So when I step over this line, and let's look around and find flag, it has the value false and you see that the debugger doesn't show 0 the way the console output did, but it actually shows false, which is much more helpful for you to understand what's going on and when we set flag = to i1 which has a numerical value of 1, now the debugger reports that as true, and when we set flag = to d1, which has a numerical value of 2.2, you can see that the debugger continues to report that as true. So using the debugger can sometimes give a little more insight into what's going on and how your data is being interpreted. The console out writing isn't always quite as useful as the debugger. To kind of illustrate that a little more firmly, I'm going to uncomment some code that I've had hidden and this is some code working with characters, but putting numbers into that character type. The reason I'm doing this with character is because it's small enough that we can all kind of know what it can hold. An unsigned character hold 8 bytes, as signed character holds 7 bytes of number and 7 bytes is a number up to 127 and 8 bytes is a number up to 255. Now, just before I uncomment this code, I want you to see that it uses the sytle of C++ comments. So you've already seen a single pair of // on a line to makes the whole rest of the line into a comment, the /* character signifies the beginning of a comment, which can be only even part of a line if you want or many lines, as this one is, and the */ indicates the end of that comment. So if I delete the beginning and the end of the comment, now this code is incorporated into my application again and I'll compile it. I'm using the keystroke Ctrl+Shift+B to Build. You can also just come up here to the Solution, right click, and choose Build Solution. So what we're doing, I mentioned an unsigned character can hold up to 255, so I'm going to put 128 in there, that's fine. We're also going to make a character which can hold up to 127 and try to put a 128 into it and see what debugger has to say about that. SO let's put a breakpoint here, and run to here. It hits the first breakpoint, I'm just going to hit Run again to run down to the second one and we'll Step through. So you can see that n1 has the numerical value 128 and this is the character that that represents. We don't really care about it as a character we're using it for numbers and n2 is showing that it holds the number -128, that's because of the way that numbers are represented in terms of bytes and the bit pattern when you try to put 128 into something that can't hold it, ends up being interpreted as the largest negative number it can hold. So when we put those onto the output, that's what it's going to print out and that can be really confusing. If we try even bigger numbers, say 254, which is about as much as n1 can hold, and n1 successfully reports back 254, again that's a very strange character, but n2 thinks that -2 and finally if we take a number that's too large for both of them like 300, they both say 44. Here's n2 saying 44 and down here you see n1 saying 44. You notice there were no warnings, no exceptions, nothing at runtime to tell us that this was a bad thing and that really brings me back to what I said before about the complier is your friend. So let's let this application run back out and I'm going to compile the application once again. So Rebuild the Solution. Normally the complier's pretty smart, it only builds things that have changed. When you choose Rebuild, it rebuilds everything whether it needs to or not and for the first time, I'm going to show you my build Output. What we have here in the Output is a whole pile of warning messages, they're not errors. The compile succeeds, the application can run, but they are all warnings from the compiler, from your friend the complier and it's saying, look you're converting, let's double click these to go to the lines, you're converting that double 2.2 and putting it in an integer, possible loss of data, yes indeed. Here, you're forcing integer value into a Boolean value and among other things that's a performance warning and of course, if you actually planned to keep the number around as a number, you've lost it, all you know is true or false at that point. Here, this warning, I'm going to truncate your 128, it won't fit in here and it goes onto continue to warn you about truncations all the time that I'm messing around with our character number. Now although you wouldn't really put outsize numbers into characters, you might accidently put outsize numbers into shorts and longs and I don't expect anyone to memorize how long these things can how, I'll show you how to find that out in just a moment, but the important thing to know is that the compiler knows how long they can hold. So that especially when you're working directly with constants, it can tell you, this data type cannot hold the number 128, you've chosen the wrong data type if 128 is what you need to put into it and that's one of the services the compiler can offer to you, as well if you take two doubles regardless of their values and multiple them together and try to put the answer into an integer. Even though they're not constants at compile time like 2.2, the complier still knows you're probably going to lose data when you take that double and put it into an integer and it will warn you about it. In many ways, the moral of the story is don't ignore your complier warning messages, read them, they are trying to help you. Now I promised I'd show you how to get the value that a certain type can hold. How big a number can you put in a char? How big a number can you put in an int and so on? If you go into MSDN and you find this page Fundamental Types, you can navigate to it what you can see based on here on the screen of this tree or you could just search for it. Then you'll find the different types in C++ along with some specific extra types that Visual C++ defines. For the best cross platform experience, you want to stick with the ones that are actually built in C++ types. So you can see here the definition of char, bool, short, int, an so on and talking a little bit about how long they are, however, I find that the best thing to figure out their length is to come down here to this chart and you can see that it takes up a byte of memory or 2 bytes of memory, or 8 bytes of memory or so on and as well, if you scroll right down to the bottom, you'll see this link here to Data Type Ranges, Here, it shows you the range that each type can hold. So int is 4 bytes, it can hold -2 billion to +2 billion and change. Char as I mentioned can hold -128 to 127, whereas unsigned char can hold 0 to 255 and so on. So if want to know what maximum and minimum numbers you can put into a particular data type, this is the place to come and look. As I say, if you're just generally working with small numbers, you might be able to get away with char, but 255 and 127 are not that big, so just go with int and generally speaking, unless you're writing an operating system, you're going to be fine and that's my advice to most people. Put integers into IntelliSense, put real numbers into doubles, and don't spend too much time worrying about what exactly what size and how many bytes the various types are until it matters it to you and when you're just getting started, it doesn't matter yet, but you have seen the types that we have in C++ now and a little bit of what happens as you move the data back and forth from one type to another.\n",

      "In the demo that we just went through, you saw data moving back and forth between say integers and doubles, doubles and integers, integers and Booleans, characters back and forth around from type to type. Yes we wrapped up with an overflow, but not all types conversions involved overflows, or loss of data, or are somehow bad. In fact, taking data in a variable of one type and putting it in another type is a very common thing to do in C++ and the complier will take care of the conversion if the types are compatible. Sometimes it will just have nothing to say about the whole process. You have an integer you want to put it in a double, no big deal, we'll promote the integer value to a double value and put that new promoted double value into your variable. If what you're doing could cause a loss of data, the complier will give you a warning. If the types are completely incompatible like a double quoted string trying to be put into a character, then the complier will give you an error and the application won't run. Once you have it complied and all you have is warnings, you're not going to get runtime errors as you move things around from one type or another. That stuff is taken care of at compile time and there are not checks at runtime that's a performance feature. Now this means that you mustn't ignore compiler warnings. Some compiler warnings are telling you about serious possible bugs like throwing away all of the decimal places in your floating point number when you put it into an integer. The problem is if you have a large project, you have normally 307 warnings, you might not notice that this morning you have 308 warnings and you really need to go and look at the new one because it's a bug waiting to happen. The solution to this of course is don't have 307 warnings. There's a mechanism called casting that lets you tell the complier, I know what I'm doing here, this is my choice, I know I don't have an integer, but you want you to turn it into an integer and then put that newly made integer into my variable. Then they'll be no more warning and it's clear to anyone who's reading your code, what it is you're trying to do. Now, can this be dangerous? Of course it can, if that's a double with points of information in it that you needed to keep and you cast it to an integer and throw them away, nobody's going to stop you. C++ the saying goes, makes it easy to shoot your foot off, and the compiler when you cast, basically says well okay it's your foot, you know you're asserting that you know what you're doing, I'm going to believe that you know what you're doing. These traditional casts, which are sometimes called c style casts are not the absolute best practice, after we've gone through templates in this material, I can show you some safer and better casts, but for now, I'm going to go through traditional C style casts, which basically tell the compiler, back off, I know what I'm doing and while we're talking about converting types back and forth, I also want to show you the suffixes that you'll occasionally see on numbers and their only allowed on numbers to indicate the type of a literal. So a literal is a number like 0 or 1, or 2.2 and these suffixes can say, I'm telling you that this is a long or I'm telling you that this is a float and that's done as a form of casting to say, I would like to take a long 0 and put it in here as opposed to a default integer 0. There's not a lot of compelling reasons why someone getting started in C++ would care what size of 0 they put into a number, but when you read in someone else's code, it can just stop you in your tracks and you say, what the heck is 0L, so I want you to see it, so that you recognize it when you bump into it.\n",

      "Let's add some casts to the demo, to make the warnings go away. I'll just Rebuild the Solution, so that you can see the warnings. Now I've commented out all of the character code again, so these warnings are putting that double 2.2 into i4. Forcing our Boolean to take an integer and forcing our Boolean to take a double. If I go to each of these in turn and cast, here's how it's done. Say round bracket, the type you would like to turn it to, close round bracket. This says, take d1 convert it to an integer and I asked for it so please don't warn me about what the consequences might be and now that that's an integer, go ahead and stick that into i4, which will of course trigger no warning because sticking an integer into an integer is fine. Let's try doing the same thing here with our flag. Take i1 and cast it to a bool and we'll take d1 and we'll cast it a bool also and I'll Build the project again. Now interestingly, the casts don't really make the bool any happier because you're still taking the number and converting it to a bool and there's still a possible performance warning associated with it, but you notice that the other warning has gone away and there's a better way to solve this problem when we get into flow of control and infrastructure and so on, you'll see how to do that. Here, we have at least gotten rid of the warning that came from this possible loss of data and so you can see that putting casts in takes some of your compiler error messages away. Now if I run the application using Ctrl+F5 the output is exactly the same as on all of the other runs. You still have the truncated value 2 put into i4, nothing in casting suddenly enables us to stick doubles into integers and have them stick around as doubles, they get truncated into integers. We've only made the compiler behavior change, we haven't made any of the runtime behavior change at all. So casts are really just a way of telling the compiler, I know what I'm doing, please don't bother me about it anymore and I said I'd show you the L suffix, let's just go here and stick an L on that. So now, I'm going to initialize out integer i1 to a long 1. Now normally longs don't fit in integers, but because 1 is small the compiler actually isn't going to have an opinion about this. So is just compile with the keystroke, and you see I just get the same two warnings about the bool as before. So it's perfectly happy to 1 into our integer and 1L is a number despite the fact that it doesn't really look like 1 and it wouldn't be 1 if you wrote it on a piece of paper.\n",

      "This module has introduced you to the idea of types that variables have a specific type like integer or bool and that you have to declare a variable before you use it. You can declare and use it all in one or you can declare it and then give it a value however many lines later you want and obviously once it's got a value, you can use it in other calculations, you saw as simply assigning the value of say i1 into that double. Different types for different kinds of data, they have different lengths, they have different maximum values in the case of numbers that they can hold. The compiler knows all this, and will help you as much as it can. There is also documentation on MSDN if you really start to get worked up about whether or not you can hold billion in your integer of what have you. You should at least have a faint inkling in the back of your mind that overflow can happen, that you don't get error messages at runtime when overflow does happen. The best way to avoid this is don't put numbers into the char type, put numbers into something like int and then you're almost certainly not going to have a problem with overflow. Occasionally, I'll see people who have database keys or other really, really big numbers and their putting them into say a short, something that can hold 32767 and when they crank over to 32768, 9, 70, the run into an overflow and are really confused and don't know what has happened. if remember that overflow exists you'll recognize this problem when you come across it. Just using ints most of the time unless you happen to be in an environment where every single byte counts is the simplest way to prevent overflow from being a problem for you. When you want to convert between two types and you're getting a compiler warning about it, stop because remember the compiler is your friend, and think about whether you actually want to throw away data or truncate a value whatever it's warning you you're going to do, and if you do then say so by casting. For now, with the round brackets as we showed in the demo. Later, after we've covered templates, I'll show you a better and safer way to cast, but for now, casting tells the compiler, don't warn me about that and that ensures that you'll continue to see warnings that you need to see from situations that you haven't thought through and weren't doing on purpose and that's when the compiler will help you out.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language C++. In this module, I'll build on the concepts you met with fundamental types and use them for user defined types, your own classes. So you'll see how to define and use objects that are instances of class that you invented. That will need us to talk about some other concepts that are really important to C++ like scope, the lifetime of an object, and we also need to discuss inheritance, namespaces, the C++ enum type, and the role of the preprocessor in a C++ application. It's quite a lot of ground to cover, but at the end of it, you'll be really ready to work with objects with instances of your own classes or classes from a library.\n",

      "An object is an instance of a class. You might define the class of it might be defined in a library like the string class that we've been using from the standard library. You define your own classes with the class keyword and if you know how to do it in some other languages like java or C#, you may believe you know how to do it in C++. You'll mostly right, the first thing that trips up a lot of people with experience in other languages is there's a trialing semicolon, so it's class, then the name of the class open brace bracket, all of the definition of the class, closed brace bracket and then a semicolon after that last closed bracket. A lot of people forget that one and I mention it because it can cause some really weird error messages that happen on the line after where you define the class. As well, the inside of the class you don't go line by line this element is public, this element is private, this element is private, private, private. Instead you have a section, you say from here down its public and then you hit the private keyword and from here down its private and if you don't say anything, the default is that it's private. C++ won't stop you from declaring public member variables, but you shouldn't, you should have private member variables and a mix of public and private functions depending on your design, you're architecture, what they're used for. So functions that you're offering to other classes to use will be public and those that are your own convenience functions will generally be private. I've mentioned before that one of the hallmarks of C++ is that your classes and classes from libraries you're using really have the same rights and responsibilities and abilities as the fundamental types. So you declare instances of employees or insurance policy or whatever your business objects are just the same way that you declare instances of integers or any of the other fundamental types that we went through in the fundamental types module. When you want to use that object, chances are what you want to do is call some member function of the object or possibly if you made a public variable access a member variable of the object and you would do that using a . syntax. You've seen the scope resolution operator before, the :: between the namespace std and the classname string for example. It also is used for static member variable and static member functions classname:: and then the element that you want to access. We're going to start simpler than that though because before you can start to access member variables and functions of objects we need to be clear about how to define a class and that's where we need to start.\n",

      "So let's write a class and then use it. Come over to Visual C++ Express and I'll use this New Project link on the Start page to New Console application as usual, and I'll put the project in my projects directory here and call it ClassesAndObjects. We go through the Wizard as always and just check here, Console application, Precompiled headers, nothing else is set hit finish. You can see that the new project template generates a main, which we'll come back to, but what I want to start with is our class. In theory, I could simply start to type the definition of the class right here in this file. It's possible for your C++ application to be one giant file. I'm going to create specific files and the project system will pull them together when we build. So I'll start by right clicking the project and saying Add, a New Item and I'll add a C++ File. I'm going to call my class Person, so I'd like a file called Person.cpp. and there's absolutely nothing in the file, it's simply an empty file that I can do whatever I like. I could type the definition of the class in here. I'm actually going to add this sort of magic invocation line that you'll see any time a project made with Visual C++ Express or any other version of Visual Studio, uses the precompiled headers. The very first line of your file needs to be this include of the standard heads, stdafx.h. If it's even second, you get error messages, so I like to put that in right away so that don't forget. Now the next thing I could do is to actually type the definition of my class. So I'm going to make a class called Person open brace, here's where the definition of the class belongs, then I'll have a closed brace and then I'll have that trailing semicolon that I mentioned and in here, all the definition of Person. However, I obviously intend to use this Person class more than just here in Person.cpp. I intend probably to use it over here and create some instances and so on from inside this main. In order to do that, main would have to know that Person was a class and that's where the header file comes in. So I'm going to Add another File into my project a Header File, which I will call Person.h and I'm going to take this definition of the Person class, Cut it out of here, and Paste it into here. Now, I can define Person in the Person.h header file and include that header file both here in Person.cpp and here in ClassesAndObjects.cpp so that I can use Person objects. Now what am I going to put in my definition of a Person? Well, we all have names, a firstname lastname, so those seem like good candidates and they are probably best represented as strings, so I'm going to add an include statement to let me use string from the standard library. So then here, inside my definition of my class, I'm going to put these three member variables. By default, everything is private unless I say that it's in the public section, but just as a matter of politeness for people who read your code, it's a good idea to specify things. So I'm going to say, private and you notice it turns blue, keyword and the : is important and now everything that list after this is going to be private until we bump into the word public. So I'm going to make a string for the Person's firstname and another string for the Person's lastname and then just so that we have something in this class that's not a string I'm going to add an integer and I'm going to call it arbitrarynumber. Depending on your business problem that you're solving this might be somebody's salary, it might be somebody's age, it might be somebody's number of dependents, it could be anything. It's just a number just so we don't all have strings inside Person here. So this header file Person.h is now doing a pretty good job of declaring the Person class. Let's go into Person.cpp and we'll add this include Person.h and I love this IntelliSense to help me remember the names of headers, Person.h is exactly what I want and then we'll come here into the main and include Person.h in here also. Once we've done that, this piece of code now knows what a Person is so I can write lines like this Person p1, Person p2, the same as declaring an integer or anything else the type and the then name that you want to call it and presto, I have some objects. Now these two objects, p1 and p2 are both of type Person, but just as if I had two integers i and j, their values are entirely independent and so it is with these people. This code allocates a Person's worth of memory for p1 and a Person's worth of memory for p2, and it's there ready to have values in it, and ready to be used. The values for most types in C++ are not defaulted or initialized for you. It's possible for objects to have them defaulted and initialized, it's not possible for integers. So if I just say integers i, it doesn't have a value it just has sort of random stuff that happened to be in memory. When we created a string in earlier demos, it was initialized to \"\" to an empty string. That's done because it's a class. The person who wrote the class decided if you just say that you have a string it should be an empty string and we have the ability, which you'll see shortly to do that for person, but I haven't yet done that for person. So Person p1 will have memory for a string for firstname, memory for a string for lastname and because their strings they'll be initialized to \"\" and it'll have memory for the integer for arbitrarynumber and that won't be initialized, so it'll just be whatever number happens to be in that piece of memory and the same will be true for p2. I'm going to show you in the debugger how this looks so that you can see what's happening with those variables. So I'll set a breakpoint on the initialization of the first Person and Run. We'll have to Build it first, I had unsaved changes when I hit Run, that's fine, Saves my changes it's going to build for me and when we reach this breakpoint, before we've executed this line, p1 is full of things that are showing debugger here in the watch window as being bad pointer, don't worry about that. Once we go over that line, you'll see that firstname has been initialized to \"\", lastname to \"\" and arbitrarynumber is just some random stuff that happened to be in that memory location, p2 is still uninitialized. We step over this line, is firstname and lastname have also been initialized to \"\" and the arbitrarynumber again, it looks like the exact same number, that's because this is a debug build and in order to help developers spot uninitialized variables being used, in debug builds the memory is sort of prepopulated with signal values. However, p1 and p2 are completely independent each with their own copies of these three variables and I'll show you that very shortly. Let's stop the debugger because obviously in order to demonstrate that these are independent we need to be able to get values into the variables. To put something in p1's firstname, put something in p2's firstname and see that they are different and that changing one didn't change the other. There are a couple of ways to do this, but since we were talking about initializing, this is the time to talk about the constructor. The constructor for a class has the same name as a class and it's used to initialize instances of that class or objects. So I'm going to add a constructor to Person. I'll go into the header file where we've declared the class and I'll add a public section because obviously this constructor isn't much good if people can't call it and the name has to be Person and it doesn't have a type before it the way some other things might because constructors, they just don't. I have to specify what kinds of values can be passed into constructor to initialize a Person. We could choose no values at all. When we make a Person their person is \"\" their lastname is \"\" and their arbitrarynumber is 0 or -1, 107, or whatever you'd like it to be. But a more useful constructor take values and puts them into the member variables. So that's what I'm going to code here. I'm going to say, that I take a string from the standard library called first and a string from the standard library called last and an integer called arbitrary and that's what this function is defined to be and I put a semicolon here. In the header file, I'm only saying that this function exists. Remember that other files include this header. They only need to know that the function exists, they don't need to know the code for it. So we'll go over here to put the code for it. To code the constructor, to code anything inside the cpp file, I have to give the full name, which includes the class name. When we're here in Person.h and I'm typing in what person takes, you can see I'm inside class Person, I'm between the open brace and the closed brace of person. Here I'm not, I'm just kicking around in space and so when I want to code that person function, I have to say before that, Person:: this is the class name and this is the function name. The function name for a constructor is always the same as the class name. It's possible, although it would be horrible practice, to have in this file the implementations of a bunch of different constructors from a bunch of completely unrelated classes and the complier could work it out. It wouldn't be a good thing to do because humans who are going to read your code couldn't work it out, but the compiler doesn't demand one file is for one class and as a result you have to specify, here's what I'm doing. I'm implementing the constructor for Person. Now I have read wiggles right now because the constructor for Person takes those three parameters the firstname, the lastname, and the arbitrarynumber and I haven't typed that part yet. So I'm actually just going to Copy that part and I'm using Ctrl+Tab to flip between the files. I'm just going to put this up onto a single line to make the rest of it a little more readable, and to define the body of the function I need an open brace and a closed brace and in between is the body of the constructor. Now here's how a lot of people would like to write this constructor. They say sure you've got a member variable called firstname, I remember that, so we'll use that put first into that and another member variable called lastname, we'll put last into that, and you got a member variable called arbitrarynumber, and we'll put arbitrary into that. This isn't exactly wrong. I can build this and although I get an error, it's not an error in Person.ccp, you can see here Person.cpp generates code, complies and then it moves onto the next file. I will discuss this error later, but here this code is fine from the compliers point of view. It is however not the correct to write and this is something that people who are comfortable in other languages come over to C++, they write code like this all the time and then experienced C++ people tell them that their wrong and they say, how can I possibly be wrong? It complies, it runs, it puts values in my variables, I don't know what you're talking about and it has to do with this idea of how you default or initialize the member variables of the object. When you code it this way, what ends up happening behind the scenes, when you create p1, is that first, all of member variables are given their memory and if they have default values they're defaulted, and then when we hit this open brace bracket, all of the member variables exist, they have memory and they've even been initialized if they can be initialized, and then their values are changed. If setting the value into a string were terribly expensive, which it isn't, this would be a real waste of time. First setting it up to its default value, then changing to the value you really wanted. Obviously for something like an integer where there is no default value, this is harmless and for strings, frankly it's not a very big deal, but it's a bad habit to get into. There are also some times when it's actually not possible to write this code, especially later when you get into inheritance you'll see that. So you want to do things right from beginning and in C++ right means using something called initializer syntax. When your initializers are expensive, initializer syntax is one of the ways you make your application perform better. One of the ways that C++ gets really obsessive about performance is saying don't waste your time initializing to a default value and the immediately changing the value, just initialize it in the first place using the value you intend to use and that's done with initializer syntax to pass along the parameters that came in, in the constructor. C++ certainly likes to be terse sometimes and the syntax for initializers is a single character we just type this : and then we rattle them off with a member variable name and what we want to initialize it to. So we say I want to initialize firstname to first, and then, I'm going to initialize lastname to last, and I can have line breaks if I want them, it just helps to make things readable, and I want to initialize arbitrarynumber to arbitrary. Once I've done that, I don't need the body anymore and this is a very common pattern to see in a constructor that the open brace and the closed brace have really nothing in between them. So the role that the constructor is serving here is to be a traffic cop and direct those three parameters off to these initializers of my three member variables. The benefit here is that if it costs to initialize that firstname, we're only going to initialize it once using the parameter that was passed in rather than once to a default value, and then assigning it the value that was passed in. So if I Build this again, you can see that Person compiled without an error. There's no output related to Person, but again we're getting these errors in ClassesAndObjects and now I want to show you what those are. So we'll go over and look here, it says Person : no appropriate default constructor available. So a constructor is this function with the same name as the name of the class and a default constructor is a constructor that doesn't take any argument and you know this is a fair complaint. If we look at all of the constructors for Person, there's only one and it takes three arguments. There isn't one that doesn't take any arguments, but some of those may be saying, I don't understand because before this way okay. Before when we said p1 we didn't pass in any arguments and the compiler had no complaint then. When you don't write any constructors you get a default constructor for free. It doesn't do anything, but it exists and it keeps the compiler happy. You can't see it, it's not generated for you by some sort of Wizard it's actually written by the compiler every time you compile your program. The minute you have one constructor, the compiler is in effect saying, I see you know what you're doing. Right, fine, if you wanted a default constructor I guess you would have written a default constructor and so it doesn't make one for you anymore and that makes this code say, well what I need here is a constructor that doesn't take any arguments since I don't have any arguments and then it can't find one, and then you get this error. You can see if I hover here, no default constructor exists for class Person. I could write a default constructor for class Person that would be trivial, but the only reason we wrote this constructor that takes the three arguments was so we could call it. So I need to change this code to call that constructor. So the syntax for initializing objects using a constructor that takes arguments is with round brackets. You may remember from the other demo you can say, int i and then on a later line you can say i=2, or you can say int i=2, or you can say int i(2) that also initializes. That round bracket syntax is the way that you'd pass one more parameters to constructors of objects. So I can say here, \" I'm going to make a person based on me, so is pass in Kate\", and my arbitrarynumber can be 123 and then we'll come down to this next line and we'll do someone else and their number can neighbor 456. So now I'm constructing my two different Person objects p1 and p2 and I'm using that three argument constructor to get values into them. So let's run again. So if we step over this first line, you can see that p1 has those values, drag this over a little so you can see all parts of it and if I Step Over here, you can see that p2 has completely different values and that changing p2 didn't change anything in p1. Hopefully, that's not a very big surprise. So we'll Stop debugging and now I'm going to briefly have a bad practice so that I can show you something and then I'll make it right again. I'm going to make one of my member variables public. You really shouldn't do this, but it lets me easily write some code to set its value without having to get into the ways you really should be setting values. We'll do that shortly. So I'm making arbitrarynumber public and then I can come in here and say, with the . syntax, p1.arbitrarynumber = 124 and we'll do for p2 also change the arbitrarynumber to 457 and we can run this, and just as we step through, you can see p1 being created with value 123 for arbitrarynumber and now you see it changed to 124, p2 being created and arbitrarynumber changing to 457. This . syntax, the objects name . field or member variable, or member function, or whatever part of it you want to talk to, happens whenever you're dealing with instances that have their own independent values. So p1 and p2 have their own arbitrarynumbers, they are accessed with a . syntax. Public member variables are a bad plan. There's more appropriate, kind of best practices, ways to deal with setting values in member variables. So I want to take this code back out, but just to demonstrate the simplicity of the . syntax, the IntelliSense to help you access that member of the class and then the pretty consistent pattern for talking to pieces of an object.\n",

      "You saw in the demo how objects can be created. What you saw without realizing that you saw it also, was objects going away. Objects have a lifetime and when you declare an object like that, Person p1, we say that's allocated on the stack. The constructor is called, memory is allocated for the object, the object is initialized and it just generally comes into being, when the flow of the control reaches the particular line on which the object is declared. So at the moment that we're on that line, Person p1 and we step over it in the debugger and having stepped over it, we've allocated the memory, we've used the constructor to initialize the object and the objects sitting there alive, but p2 is not yet. Then we go over the next line in the debugger and now p2 is allocated and constructed. When those two objects what we say go out scope, which means reaching a closed brace bracket in most cases, then the memory is freed and the opposite of a constructor, known as a destructor, runs. Destructors don't have to be written, they don't have to do anything. The case of Person, there's no need to write a destructor to clean up at the end of the objects lifetime. There are some kinds of objects for which you do need to write a destructor and in C++ we have this saying or this idiom RAII, Resource Acquisition is Initialization and that's a way of thinking that says, if I have a resources that needs to be managed, let's say an open file or a database connection, or even something like the Windows cursor. In the constructor I will acquire the resource, that is I'll open the file, I'll open the database connection, I'll change the Windows Cursor to a weight symbol and I'll do the opposite and release the acquisition and cleanup in the destructor. So I'll close the file in the destructor. I'll close the database connection in the destructor. I'll put the cursor back to where it should be in the destructor. and this pairing up the resources are required in the course something and released in the destructor, means that developers really don't need to think about it. They create an object on the stack, constructor goes off, stuff gets acquired. Later it goes out of scope, destructor goes off, stuff gets released and in the old school days, if you're a person who ever worked in C, where you have to say now remember to close things when you're done with them, remember to open things before you use them. This approach says, look relax, when you construct the object we will acquire whatever needs to be acquired in order for you to use the object. We'll open the file, or we'll open the connection, or whatever and when you're done with it, when it goes out of scope, it will cleanup itself. You may have heard that in C++ you have all this complicated difficult memory management and you have to delete things and all this, that's just not true. There are some ways of programming in C++ that puts a tremendous burden on the developers to just remember a million things, but the RAII approach which says, when you make an object the constructor gives it to you ready to use whatever needs to be opened is opened, whatever needs to allocated is allocated and the destructor will close it up and clean it up for you. That way, when people especially when you get to use objects from a library, they just work, they do what they need to do. I'm going to stay away from opening files, making connections to databases, changing Windows cursors because they're reasonable difficult tasks to do, but I am going to show you how this works.\n",

      "I'm going to come back into Visual C++ Express and come into the Person class and I'm going to add a line to the constructor that just prints out a statement that we're in constructor, that'll help to be able to track when the constructor runs and after we add a destructor, we'll also be able to check when the destructor runs. I'd like to print something out on the screen, so that means I need to include iostream. Then I can just come in here and say, in the standard library I'd like to use cout and I'll send it constructing and just so I can tell them apart, I'll send the firstname and a space and the lastname and then an endline character. Now every time we construct something, they'll put output written out that we can take a look at. I'm now going to add a destructor to this class. It doesn't really have any genuine work to do, we don't allocate or acquire any resources when we're initializing a person, so we don't need to clean any up, but I'm just going to add one so that we can have an out statement and the rules for a destructor is that the name is this ~ followed by the name of the class and it doesn't take any parameters and then in here, I'm going to implement the destructor. When writing the constructor, we have to start with saying the name of the class and then the name here of the destructor and it doesn't take any arguments and it has an open and a close. I'm just going to Copy this line and now we're going to print out when the destructor goes off. I could just run this code as is, I'm going to make one small change, I mentioned that scope ends when control reaches a brace bracket, you can have a brace bracket for whatever reason you want. You might have them as part of some ifs and loops and things we haven't covered yet, but you can also just randomly have them and what happens when I do this is as we go through, first p1 will be constructed, then p2 will be constructed, then when we hit this closed brace, p2 will go out of scope and be cleaned up and the destructor will go off. Then we'll return from the function and that will cleanup p1, p1 will get destructed. Let me prove this to you. I don't need to do this under the debugger, I'll just use Ctrl+F5, let it Build. First we constructed p1, which is me, then p2 which is someone else. Then because we reached that closed brace, we destructed p2 and finally, destructed p1. Understanding the scope of objects that you allocate is important to know. The constructor goes off when control reaches that line. The destructor goes off when the object goes out of scope. I didn't need to keep track of these Person objects myself and clean them up, destructors went off simply because control reached this closed brace and that took the object out of scope. The important thing to understand is that much of this is done for you automatically and it's an important part of thinking like a C++ developer.\n",

      "I want you to be able to read and understand C++ code that come across and C++ code that I show you and in order to do that, I really want to minimize the times when I say, don't worry about this little magic invocation, we'll cover it later and when I have to do that, I want to come and close that loop up again as soon as I can. A couple things therefore that I want to talk about now because I think you're going to be able to understand the code I show you better, if you've seen these things. First I want to mention struct. Struct is a lot like a class. It's a user defined type. It's often used for what we call plain old data or POD classes. They don't really have any business logic. Take a point for example, it has and x and a y, it doesn't have a method to validate it and make sure that it's legitimate point, or to put it in the database, or to update it for a new fiscal year, it's just an x and a y. Struct however can have everything that classes cam have. They can have functions in them, include a constructor and a destructor, but they only have one difference, literally once difference. I mentioned that if you don't say public versus private in a class the default is private. In a struct, the default is public, that's the only difference and you should never use the default anyway you should always say the following stuff is private, the following stuff is public and then that turns into there being no difference whatsoever between a struct and a class. As a matter of practice, most developers like to use structs for POD classes and classes for full on classes, but it could go either way. I've shown you how to write classes. I should show you at least the syntax for inheritance. Some of the significances and importantance of inheritance will really only come into play as we move into doing more with our classes, but I'll show you how inheritance works to get you started for that and I wanted to talk about namespaces. We've been using the std namespace on and saying std:: string to day this is a standard class from the standard library. A little bit more about namespaces and a little less typing, just so that your code will be a little more , the way everyone else's cod is and then enum, which is a concept in a lot of languages just a way to give names to constants. The C++ enum is a little bit different from some other languages enum, so I want you to see it and know how it works.\n",

      "I'm going to add a class into this project. It needs to be a special kind of person, something that can inherit from person but add capability and noun that some people are, but not all people are. I'm just going to choose to represent someone who is on Twitter, a Tweeter if you will, and a Tweeter will be a person with some extra capabilities or some extra member variables. In our case specifically, a twitterhandle. Now I could create this class the same way I created the Person class, by hand adding a cpp file, and an h file and typing some code into them. I want to show you another way to add a class into a project and to be honest, it's the way you'll probably use most often. I wanted you to see it how to do it by hand first and then how Visual Studio helps you. So I'll come up here to the Project, right click, choose Add, and now scroll down here to class. I'll choose a C++ Class and this brings up a Class Wizard to help you add classes into your system. You give it a Name, let's say Tweeter, and you can see that it's naming the h file and the cpp files that it's going to generate for you. I want Tweeter to be inheriting from Person, so to have a Base class, that's the C++ terminology of person, and we'll leave this Access as public for now and leave these things unchecked because that way I don't have to explain them just yet. I'll click Finish and you can see that it adds the header file Tweeter.h and the cpp file, Tweeter.cpp to my project. It generates a constructor and a destructor for me and implementations with nothing in the of those two methods and you can see the appropriate includes have also been put in my file for me. I want to have strings, I'm going to make the Person's twitterhandle for example a string, so let's and include of string (typing) and I'll add a private section (typing) and a member variable for their twitterhandle. This constructor that has been generated for me, doesn't take any parameters, but if a Tweeter is a person and a person has a firstname, a lastname, and an arbitrarynumber then a Tweeter has a firstname, a lastname, and a arbitrarynumber, that's the whole point of inheriting and we'd like to have a constructor that can set them and as well a Tweeter has a twitterhandle. So I'm going to take these three parameters from our Person.h Put them in here along with a fourth parameter for the handle and then these will be the four parameters to the constructor in the implementation file and again, I'm going to use the initialization syntax and initialize the parts of Tweeter that are a person, as well as the part that is special in a Tweeter. You might think the way to do that would be the way we did it over in Person. So I'd say initialize firstname to first, firstname is part of person. We have a perfectly good way to get a person object initialized, and that is with its constructor, and that's what I'm going to use here. So I'll say, I want to use the Person constructor and pass in first, last, and arbitrary and I will also initialize twitterhandle using handle. So with this approach, I'm relying on the Person constructor to handle initializing the Person part of Tweeter and I'm using this syntax to initialize the twitterhandle part of Tweeter. I will Copy from this implementation, print statement to put some stuff on the screen and in order for that to work I'm going to need this include line and I'm going to add the word tweeter here and instead of putting out the firstname and the lastname, is just put out their twitterhandle and then we'll put that down here in the destructor. Let's come back into the main class and instead of having some Person only, we're going to also have some Tweeters so I'll include Tweeter.h. Now for reasons I'll explain very shortly, I'm going to comment out the include of Person. I'm going to leave Person p1 as myself and change this Person to being a Tweeter and we need to pass this fourth parameter into the constructor, I don't actually know someone else's handle so we'll use whoever and apologizes if that's someone real Twitter handle. Just to really clarify what's happening with scope, I'm going to add another line here (typing) which will work best if it has the header. So we're going to construct a Person. We're going to construct a Tweeter, when we hit this closed brace, we're going to destruct the Tweeter, then we're going to print out this line, then we'll destruct the person. Let's let his run with Ctrl+F5 and you can see what happens. Let's pull this over a bit and let you compare the code to the output. First we constructed the Person object, then we constructed the Tweeter object. As part of constructing the Tweeter object, the Person part of its constructor went off and said constructing Someone Else and after that was complete the derived class, the Tweeter part of the constructor went off, put the twitterhandle value basically in. We hit this closed brace and the destruction happened in the opposite order. First we ran the derived class destructor which said destructing tweeter@whoever and then the compiler ran the Person part of the destructor which said destructing someone else. Then we printed out this line that says after innermost block and finally, the destructor went off for p1. This sort of order of operations that the base part constructor happens first and then the derived part constructor is really important. It means that code in a derived constructor and count on its based class part being fully initialized already and it also means that when you're destructing that the derived part cleans up its own stuff and then relaxes and lets the base class cleanup it's part. So if the base class managed a file, the derived class would know the file was still open during its destructor and then base class might close the file for example and this is a really important aspect of understanding scope and of understanding resources acquisition is initialization. It's taken care of for you and it's taken care of you in a specific order every time.\n",

      "lines: \n",
      "It's time to cleanup some lose ends and one of the most annoying lose ends is having to keep typing std:: whatever before say cout. This is the namespace std and the functionality that comes from the standard library is all in this namespace, which is wonderful. It means that I can call my classes whatever I like. If I want to write a string class, I can write a string class and I'll be able to tell them apart by talking about standard string and Kate's great library:: string and it would possible to mix and match them in the same application without any confusion and that is fantastic. It means that no words are really reserved. String is available to be the name of your class, as long as you don't mind confusion in the minds of other developers. Everything that's part of the standard library is inside the standard namespace and you can have things with exactly the same name in your namespace, if you want. My problem is with having to type the name of the namespace every single time I use these classes when I haven't written my own string or my own console out. Well of course, I don't have to. Of course, there's a mechanism to get around it and it's as simple as calling it out like this. I can say for example, I will be using from the standard library, cout. Or I will be using from the standard library, endl and if I do that, then I can come down here and just call them cout and endl. Now that in itself is a big improvement. This isn't any kind of directive about going and picking certain things out of the larger library, it doesn't change the size of my executable for example, it simply a convenience to the compiler and saying, whenever you see just plain cout, I mean std::cout, I mean the standard cout, I just don't want to type it's whole name every time. When you're going to use a number of things from the same namespace, it can get tiring to keep adding more things so there's another approach. I can come into say the Person class where I'm using both cout and I'm also using string, I could come here and say using the entire namespace std. Having done that I can now go through and take away in front of every string, as well as in front of cout and endl. and you can see I don't have any red wiggles, the compiler is fine with that. Now there are some languages in which using has a different meaning, it has to do with controlling scope, we have brace brackets for scope, using never has anything to do with scope. Using is only about these namespace directives, it doesn't link new code in or add new references, anything it's simply telling the compiler, when I say cout and you think, I don't know what you're talking about, quick go and see if it's std::cout and if it is, we're both happy. So it's basically what the compiler does with identifiers it doesn't immediately recognize like string, cout, and endl in this example. Sometimes people want to put this using namespace whatever in a header file, that is a bad plan. Right now, I can use Person and still have my own string class. Person works with standard strings my code could work with my own strings. The minute there's a using namespace standard inside Person, now everyone who wants to use Person has to agree not to have collisions with something that is in std and that's too big of thing to ask. You can do it in a cpp file, don't do it in an h file. In a header file, you can call everything out by its full name or have individual using statements like the ones we had here for individual parts of the standard namespace, but I prefer to see those using namespace whatever's only in cpp file and not in h files. Now my code looks a little neater, has a little less punctuation in it, and I think it's easy to understand and read it as long as you can remember cout is from the standard library, string is from the standard library, but Person and Tweeter are not, they're no longer being decorated as being different. Now of course Visual Studio will help you, so if I hover over Person, it shows me that it's just class Person, but if I hover over say string in here, it's got a big long definition and it's got std:: and in its definition as a reminder that this is the standard string from the standard library.\n",

      "So far, we've worked with fundamental types like integers, and floating point numbers, objects whether defined in the library like string, in the standard libraries, or in our own code like Person and Tweeter and I've mentioned structs which are essentially identical to classes. Just to round the picture out, I want to talk about enums. So I'm going to add another header file into this system and I'm going to call it status.h and in here I'm going to define an enum called Status and like a class an enum has its definition inside braces and has a ; at the end of that last brace and we simply list out the possible Statuses. Now an interesting thing about C++ enums for people who have come from other languages is that when you use them, you only use these internal things. So I wouldn't say Status.Pending, I would just say Pending. That means that these names need to be unique. I can't have Approved as part of a Status enum and also have it as part of a completely different unrelated enum. Very often, when you read other people's code, you will therefore see decorations, bits of extra words like it might be status.pending, status.approved, status.canceled, to keep that uniqueness in an enum. I'm going to keep these ones simple and we'll just use one. So if I go back into my main I'll just declare a Status s give it a value like pending. You can see the compiler saying what, don't know what you're talking about? It's because I haven't included the header file. So let's go up here status.h, give it a minute, it should become content down here and once I've declared the variable, I can obviously change this value at anytime just as did with integers and so on. So I can say now that s = Approved and that's a legitimate thing to do. So if I Run the application, under the debugger, and we'll just step through all this part, and see here s is just an arbitrary value at the moment --- control hasn't reached that line, so it hasn't been initialized yet. We step over that line and the debugger actually shows the enum value Pending and we go down to this line, it shows the enum value Approved. So in the debugger I can see the word value rather than any underlying number that's inside of it and it saves you as a developer having to memorize a lot of strange numeric values for error codes and status and the like and it makes debugging simpler as well.\n",

      "In all of the code you've seen so far, you've had some lines that start with this #, or hash, or pound symbol. Most famously you've seen the include statement. This is a directive to the pre-processor. It actually just combines the file in together. So when you say include Person.h, it picks a copy of all the lines in Person.h and plunks them in right where that line appeared. People can do some very powerful and interesting things with pre-processor directives. We've talked a couple times about I'm doing a debug, you could also do a release build and things are different in a debug build then they are in a release build and you can actually use the pre-processor to make different versions of functions for example, that have more output in them during a debug, and less output in for example a release build. I don't want to go down the road of all the things you can do with the pre-processor, many people try to use it as little as possible. They really just use it for includes, but there's one thing you do need to be able to see when you see it in other peoples code and to be able to do it in your own and that's the convenience of not having to memorize the structure of all of the headers that your system uses. There's a concept known as include guards. This is easiest to see in a demo, so let's just get straight into it.\n",

      "In the demos that I've shown you so far, I had to comment out this line, Person.h and I'll show you why by taking away the commenting out and building. See all these errors? Person, class type redefinition, see declaration of Person, What? What happens is I explain to the compiler what a Person is by including Person.h and then I include Tweeter.h and if I just go there you'll see that that first things that Tweeter.h does is include Person.h and the pre-processor Pastes that same include file in again and then says, what, Person again, well that's an error, our persons already been defined, we can't have two classes called Person in the same namespace and you get an error. So because we're really focusing in that demo on the mechanics of inheritance, I didn't want to get into that, we just commented the line out, but obviously we have to fix something about that. Now the old fashion way would be to have someone include both files, get an error, and then say I get it, Tweeter brings in Person, so I don't need to bring in Person, so I'll just take this line away. I don't like that. I don't like having to build a tree in your head of all the possible things that have been included by other things. You just should be able to say what you use and then let them work it out amongst themselves and there are a variety of ways to do it, here is a way that many, many developers use. You go into the header file and we're going to add directives in here that basically prevent it from ever being included twice. So if someone tries to include Person.h a second time, the header file itself will recognize that it's already been included and not define the class again and therefore not trigger the error messages and we're going to do this using some pre-processor directives that can define arbitrary constants and people use this to say for example, define pi to be 3.14 15 etc and then they can use pi in their calculations. We're going to define some constants that really just indicate, we must have been this way before because this constant is already defined. Once you've defined a constant, you can test to see if it's defined or not and that's how we'll know what's going on. So the constant by tradition, is based on the name of the file, that way they won't conflict or clash with each other. So for example, I might define _Person_H and that's a variable that represents the name of this file Person.h. If that's already defined, we must have already included this file. If it isn't defined yet, we haven't yet included this file. So before I define it, I test, ifnotdef _Person_H and then I'm going to put the end of that all the way down here. So what's happening is, if Person.h is not yet defined, great, in comes the whole rest of the file. We define Person.h, we declare the Person class and everything is as before, but if Person.h is being included for a second time, when the pre-processor is doing that including and it reaches this ifnotdef, it says, oh but it is defined, okay, we'll skip down here to the endif and as a result Person does not get included again. So let's Build this and you can see there's no error messages, this works perfectly. The main file ClassesAndObjects can now include Person and Tweeter without worrying that they have some kind of relationship or that one includes the other, or that it matters what order, it all just kind of works the way that it should and this pattern is called an include guard. Whatever your arguments for or against include guards are, please don't compiler performance be one of them. This is a relatively high performing way to solve this particular problem, but it's not the only way. There is another way that isn't standard. So this is standard it will work in every C++ compiler in the universe. They all understand the idea of defining a constant and they understand the idea of testing against the constant and some of them, for example Visual Studio, can also be reasonably smart about realizing the endif is at the very end of the line, so I don't even need to process the rest of the file. There is another approach, that you can take and in fact, when we added that class using the Wizard, Visual Studio took this approach for us and that's this directive here, pragma. As you can see it's a pre-processor directive just like include, or define, or ifnotdefined and pragma, once says, this particular file should only be included once in each compilation unit. It's the same things behind the scenes, the compiler generates the unique identifier and makes sure that if it gets included again it doesn't actually process it again. Some people find this more readable, some people find it less readable. There may be compilers out there that don't recognize it in which case you would need to write the old include guard way anyway. You're welcome to use pragma once if you prefer it to include guards. You should be to recognize include guards when you see them in someone else's header files and understand what's going on and if you're copying someone else's code for your own purposes and you copy include guards, make sure you change the name of the defined variable that you're using to guard the include with to something that represents your new file name otherwise you're get really strange behavior where I know I'm including this file, but the compiler's acting like I'm not because if two files actually both test the same variable, they can't both get included, that's never going to be a good thing. So you have to understand how include guards work in order to be able to understand other people's code. If you would prefer to do the prama once and you're only going to be working in Visual Studio, or Visual C++ Express, that's fine, pragma once will work beautifully, they're both available to you.\n",

      "This module has covered a lot of ground. You've seen how you can make your own classes and then just declare instances of those classes on the stack, just like fundamental types. So you can make an integer, you can make a person, you can make something that is of type enum, just on the stack. When you make an object, and instance of a class on the stack like this, it's lifetime is managed for you. When the instance goes out of scope, the object gets cleaned up. Any memory it was using is released and the destructor runs, which might close a file, close a database connection, or in the demos you saw in the module, just write a message on the screen. You also saw the order in which constructors and destructors run when you're using inheritance hierarchy for your classes. You know both user defined types, Person, Tweeter, or string, which while it wasn't defined by me as a user, it was defined by a user and not by the language itself, and the fundamental types like int, and double, and bool, they're all just as real as each other and they can be used in the same ways. They can initialized, they can go in and out of scope, they have their lifetimes managed, there's no special distinction that says, when it's a user defined type you have to create it this way. You create them the same way and they live the same kind of lives. Your classes can do whatever fundamental types can do and one of the most important classes to any developer is a string class. There's one in the standard library, which you can get started using from day one. It's a great example of how important user defined types can be in every application. Just because their defined by a user doesn't mean their defined by you, it just means they're not built into the language itself. Now that you understand objects, and variables, and types, you understand I hope why the complier is your friend and you're ready to write applications that actually do at besides just declaring variables and putting values in them.\n",

In this module, you'll really see how to build a program using loops, conditionals, those other flow of control statements that essentially all programming languages have. Some of the C++ ones aren't as well known as things that are common in other languages. I have some lightning quick demos that don't really do anything useful, but they show how all these constructs work. This is also a good time to start to talk about functions, the real building blocks of just about every application.

Normally speaking, control flows from one line to the next, integer x = 2, x = 3, print something out showing the value of x and they all just happen in that order, but just about every programming language has some way to change that around and you should probably recognize things like if, and while, you can also call a function. They're pretty simple things to get, the trick maybe is the syntax and the C++ syntax I'll show you in working code, so that you can see how it's done and remember as I like to say, the complier is your friend so that if you mess up and leave off some brackets, you'll get an error message, then you'll know what to do about it. Things that are a little difficult in C++, there are a for loop, not every language has a for loop. The switch statement and the Immediate if. I also want to talk about the break, which is relevant in while and for and a few other places and I'm just going to mention that goto exists. I don't have a goto demo, I don't want you to use goto, it's there if you happen to read, is a goto, but all those years ago we said goto is considered harmful and for those who aren't in on the joke consider harmful has really become the nastiest insult you can give a language feature.

The round brackets are not optional, if you leave them out you're going to get a syntax error. Your condition could be something like x is > than 0, y+2 is > than some function or another, any expression you like and you can test against things that are not Boolean values. You can test against numbers and it's quite common actually to see C++ people do that. When somebody tests against 7, or variables that are not Booleans, their converted to Booleans using the rules we talked about before, 0 is false, everything else is true, going to the if or not. So for example if x>3, y=7. You can put a line break in there if you like, like this, they're both exactly the same complier couldn't care less and it's important to note, compiler does not read indents and doesn't understand anything special, based on whether or not you indent the lines, those are for humans. So if you're going to have your action across multiple lines you have to enclose it in braces and I prefer to use them even for a single line, like this. If x>3 { y=7 }. The reason I prefer them is simple. When you go and add a second line, you can add it between the braces and it'll still works. If you just add a second line when you didn't have any braces and you forget to add them, you get weird bugs because nobody complains, but the second line gets executed every single time regardless of whether the if is true or not. So as a best practice, always have braces even when there's only a single line in your action. Now you can have an else clause if you like, it just goes immediately after the if and if has all the same rules about single line, multiple line with braces, best practices to have braces. You don't have to have an else if you don't want to. If you have a lot of ifs and elses all kind of muddled up together, sometimes the complier can match ifs up with the wrong else, braces can help there to make it really clear what your intent is.\n",

      "I have a super quick demo to show you and because I've not covered all of the C++ operators, I'm just going to keep using >, I think it's pretty readable and obvious how > works and that'll make the demo perhaps not utterly thrilling, but at least we'll be able to focus on how if works and how else works. So let's come over into Visual C++ Express. You can see that I'm going to ask you to enter two numbers. We're going to use standard see n to get those values and I'm not doing any error checking or validation about whether you went through numbers or letters or anything like that because that's not the point of this particular demo. So it's not going to work right if you don't work it right, so I have a simple if, if x > y, we'll put out that it's larger and it has an else and I've put braces around both clauses even though they're only a single line just because I feel that a best practice. Now a momentary word about bracing style. People have arguments about braces positioning that far exceed the arguments that they can have about politics, or religion, or any other major touch points and I'm not going to go there. The bracing style I'm using is the default in Visual Studio. You can tell Visual Studio if you have a different style. So some people prefer to indent the braces so they line up here with the contents of the if and some people like to put the first braces up here on the same line as the if. I'm not going to argue the pros and cons, there are many different bracing styles. If you're working for a company that has a style guide, follow the style guide for your bracing. If you're updating someone else's code, do not go in there and \"fix\" that person's bracing style while you're making whatever changes your making. For one thing, it makes difs very difficult when you go through the source control to decide what was done, but also the chances are the next person's just going to \"fix\" it right back again. So don't get into a brace alignment war, what I'm showing you here is what Visual Studio does if you don't tell it any differently and if you have to use a different style, get Visual Studio to help with that by changing the options so that it respects your particular bracing style. Really simple test, here's an if with an else and if I just scroll down a little further, I want to show you that you can have an if without an else if you want and you also can have a single line without braces. The reason that I like to have braces no matter what is because people tend to believe that if they came here and wrote some other line like change y=3 when the total is > 10, that it somehow is associated with the if, but it isn't. Only the line immediately after the if is executed just when the if is true. So this y=3 line would get executed every time, whether the if was true of false and we say the complier doesn't read indents. Since I started saying that many years ago, languages have been invented that do read indents, but C++ isn't one of them. So if you always have braces, then when you add another line it will naturally get caught up and this is just a mistake and you don't want to do it. It's a pretty simple program, it's going to run. It'll print out is larger than or is not larger than and in the case, that I happen to choose two numbers that add to more than 10, it'll also print this extra piece of information. I'm going to Run it a few times so that you can see. So I'll run with Ctrl+F5 and if I enter 4 and 5, it prints out 4 is not larger than 5, that's right, and 4+5 is only 9, so we didn't get the extra thing about thanks for large numbers. Let's just run it again 6 is larger than 4, 10 is not larger than 10, so we still don't get that message and I run it one more time 55 is not larger than 66, thanks for choosing larger numbers! So I hope no one's really surprised to learn how if's work in C++, they work as they do in whatever language you happen to know and as you can see, you can have more complex expressions in those round brackets if you want them I'm just happening to choose simple expressions because it makes the demos simple.\n",

      "If since you're code threw one branch of the conditions true and possibly through a different one if it's false and then life carries on as before, after the if. While, is for doing things over and over. So the syntax is while something or another condition holds, some action and just like if, the round brackets are not optional, you can have braces if action is multiple lines and the like. If it's never true at all, their first time they check condition fails, then the stuff in the loop never happens. You're not guaranteed to have it happen once, the check is at the top. If you want to exit the loop earlier, there's a keyword break, that does just that. So you might for example be going to through a file looking for something, once you found it there's no need to process the rest of the file break. Pretty simple especially once you know if.

      "Flipping over to Visual Studio I have a really simple application that asks you for a number and I'm going to work out if it's prime or not. So I'm going to assume it's prime and then I'm going to go through a while loop looking for factors. If I find a factor, it's not prime. If I come all the way through the while loop and didn't find a factor, it must still be prime. I'm using a different operator, I'm using <=, hopefully everyone can recognize that and this is a bit of a trick if you haven't done a lot of calculating of primes. It's enough to go until the number you're testing as a factor is larger than if I were to divide that number into the original number. So in the case of 102, if I divide 51 into it, getting 2, 2 is less than 51 so I've already tried the other half of the factor in other words. So it's just a little optimization to make your loop go faster and I am really only including it so that you can again see that we can have more complex constructs in our conditions for our whiles. So what do I do each time I go through this loop? I try to figure out what the factor would be and I'm taking something that's almost certainly not an integer and putting it into an integer. We talked about this in data types, that's going to silently truncate the result, which is exactly what I want. So if I'm testing whether or not 2 goes into 7, I'll take 7 divide it by 2, get 3 and a bit, that'll get truncated out to 3. Then on the next line, I multiple it back 3*2 is 6 which is not = to 7, so in this case, this if would fail and we would come out. When it does =, it's because the numbers actually a factor. Now we'll take more about operators later, but I do want to show you the == being used for testing equality in C++. Something in the operators section we'll take more about that, just pointing it out here. So if we did find a factor, we'll print that out, normally apps don't, but I'm trying to be transparent here and set out Boolean prime to false. Super important if you're going to do a loop with a while you have to do something to move you towards getting out of the loop. If you're looping while you read a file, you should read another line of the file. If you're looping while you're process a data set, you should move onto the next row of the data set and so on. Here, I'm just going to increment i. There are better ways to increment i, but those can wait for the operators material. That's the loop, once we come out the other end, we can test that Boolean variable prime and print out using our new found skills whether it's prime or not and that's the whole application. So I'm going to Run it let's test 7, 7 is prime. Let's run it again. Let's test 25, 25 has a factor, it makes sense, 25's not prime. Now, I have a little bit of an optimization in this app in that I only go up as high as I need to and not all the until I've tested up to the value X of the number of I put it, but I have an inefficiency still in place. Let's try running one more time and this time I'll put in 12, a number that has a lot of factors. You see it finds the factor 6 and 4, it concludes that 12 is not prime, but as soon as we found the first factor 6, we knew 12 wasn't prime, there's no need to continue to go and find other factors. I can make this exit once it's understood that this isn't a prime number. This is a great use of the break keyword. Break gets you out of the loop you are in. So here, it doesn't get it out of ifs of anything, it gets you out of whiles and when we do fors, it also gets you out of fors and some other constructs. So what'll happen is if we find a factor, we'll break out of the while loop and rather than incrementing i and going to back up to test again whether or not i is still less divided by the new i, we'll just come straight out to the line after the close brace of the while and this just makes the code in this example a little more efficient. You wouldn't do this if you wanted to find every one, but it's a common idiom to have to find the first of something and this is a simple way to stop, once you have found that first one. So I'll Run it and again, we'll do 12. This time it only finds the factor 6, it doesn't go on and find the factor of 4 because break took us out of the while. You can see that once you know if, you also really know a lot of the rules around while, pretty straightforward.\n",

      "nline: 19\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "In addition to while, C++ also has the for loop. For loops are made up of three parts. There's the initializer that starts the beginning of the loop. So if you want to do something 10 times you might initialize to 1, if you were going to go from 1 to 10 or to 0 if you're going to go from 0 to 9. You can declare a database here in the initializer. If you do that, then the variable goes out of scope when the for loop is over or you can use a variable that's already in scope and it will continue to be in scope at the end of loop. Next, we have a condition using exactly the same kinds of expressions you can use for if and while. That means Boolean expressions but also things that evaluate to something other than a Boolean and then we have the loop expression, the thing that moves you onto the next item in the loop. So in our while, we have to remember by hand at the bottom of the loop to put i = i + 1 and you'll sometimes see while loops where the increment is in the middle, especially if it's something like reading a file. The for loop expression is always done as the very last thing, so the whole loop body gets executed and then the loop expression, and then we come around and test the condition again and if appropriate go and execute the loop again. So here's a sample for loop for int i=0, i < 10; i = i + 1 and again, there's a better way to increment i, which we'll cover later. Now this loop runs from 0 to 9, 10 is not less than 10 and running from 0 to 9 is the very C++ way to do something 10 times. Because i has been declared right here in the initializer, after the for loop i will be out of scope. That's great, it lets you sort of throw away these variables whenever you want. Sometimes people want to use the loop variable afterwards. In that case, you need to declare it on the line before int i and then 4 i = 0, i < 10 and so on.\n",

      "Because for and while are so similar, I took the while example and rewrote it as a for example, so I didn't have to explain it again. Enter a number and now I'm using a for loop int i=2. I don't need i after the loop so I'm declaring it right there. The condition and the increment are what you recognize from the while. You're much less likely to forget to increment and accidently write an infinite loop when you use a for loop, by the way. The body's exactly the same and we can break out of a for the same as we can break out of a while and the printing out exactly the same. So let's run this. We'll enter a number, let's try 25, 25 is not a prime. Hopefully, no one is surprised by any of these results. Let's try another one, 7 is prime and just to demonstrate breaking out of the for loop let's choose a number with plenty of factors, let's try 24 this time instead of 12. First factor it finds when it's trying to, it finds 12, not prime, breaks out of the for loop. So there you go. They're not importantly different to the compiler. For and while are importantly different to people and the ability to control that scope to have the loop variable disappear after the loop is a big plus for many people. They don't really want to liter their code with a bunch of different loop variables, i, j, k, ii, jj, so being able to use one like this, that comes into scope and goes out of scope, and be a highly useful thing, and I have a little more guidance a little later on about for versus while.\n",

      "lines: \n",
      "Switch really solves only one problem, but it's a problem that happens a lot, it's a pattern that's super common in your applications and that's when you basically have a whole pile of ifs because you're trying to figure out which condition you're in. So affects is 1, do something or another affects is 2 do something or another, affects 3, do something else and it's a little inefficient to do it that way because the compiler would keep testing. Once you know that x is 1 it can't possibly be 2 or 3, and yet you're testing your ifs over and over, so then people write nested ifs. So they write if x is 1 do this else, brace bracket, if x is 2 do this else and you sort of nest and nest and nest it, it gets really hard to read. The switch statement is just a cleaner version that people can clearly follow. Here's the syntax, other languages have this, but the exact word that's used varies from language to language. Where the brackets and braces and what not also very vary, so we have round brackets around the expression, just as with an if, just as with a while. Must have a and open brace immediately after that and a closed one, not optional and then you have one or more case statements and each one of them is case value: what to do and then a break, and optionally at the end of it all, you can have a default: and what to do. If you leave the break off, control just falls down and executes the next case for you, which is sometimes what you want, usually not what you want. Then you have a closed brace at the end of the whole thing to say okay, I'm all done with the switching. You don't have to have a default, so it's not like the complier can say, I processed the default, so I must be done, it needs that to let it know. You don't put brace brackets after each case because you keep going until you hit the break, so there's no need for braces after each individual case statement. The expression you're switching on, needs to work out to an integer. It's very common to switch on the value of a single variable, but it could be some expression or in a enum, which are integers behind the scenes and the individual case statements you're testing against integer values also or enum values.\n",

      "I have a demo of a switch statement and I'm sort of pulling in some other things that we've already covered, to make the demos a little easier to use. So for example, it's kind of annoying to have to keep running the demo three, four, five times, to show the results of three or four different paths through it, I've decided to put this loop in here. As long as you enter some positive number, let me just follow this brace down, you can see the last thing that happens in the loop is I'll ask you again for a number, we'll hit the brace bracket, and we'll come back up and do this while again, and that way with a single run, we can test a number of different values. So what's happening inside the while loop, well with have this switch statement and we're switching on x, which is integral type so that's fine. Here's the non-optional open brace and the non-optional close brace at the end of the switch statement and everything in between is our switch and I have a number of different cases. So case 1, that is when x = 1, I'll tell you that you entered 1 and I have a break. Something you'll see quite often is two labels right after each other, so 2 and 3 are right after each other. This is deliberate and it means that you want to do the same thing for both 2 and 3. Since we're not doing anything real all I can say is well you must have entered 2 or 3, but imagine a circumstance where you process both canceled and delayed things the same. So you might have case canceled: and immediately case delayed and then all the code to handle delayed and canceled whatever these are. However, sometimes people do it accidently, so I've simulated that accidentalism here with 4 and 5. There should be a break at the end of case 4 and there isn't and I'll show you happens when the break is missing and then we have the default. So I'm going to run this through for a whole whack of numbers, obviously, and let's do that now. So if I put in 1, it says you entered 1 and that's fine. If I say 2, you entered 2 or 3 and 3 will also say you entered 2 or 3. When I say 4, it says you entered 4 you entered 5. Let's flip back to the code. Because there's no break, it fell through to the 5 case and also executed the case for 5. probably not what I wanted, we'll try 5, try something else and finally 0 and we're out. The switch statement certainly takes up a lot less room than many, many nested lsifs and it's more efficient than just if, if, if, if testing the same thing over and over again. After all, once we've establish that x is 1 there is no way that it's 4. Also stacking these up like this, is more readable than combining them with or, you haven't seen combining with or yet, but trust me this is more readable. So for certain kinds of architecture of your application, the switch statement is really useful. In modern C++, there are some alternatives especially when you're working with objects and you variable hierarchies, you can rather than switching on sometimes you can have your objects be of different type and have an implementation of a virtual function in that type handle whatever this is, so you may not see as much switch statements, but when you see them I want you to be able to read them and I certainly don't want you writing big long nested lsifs, when you could've just used a switch.\n",

      "That brings us to calling functions, really the heart of most applications. We've already seen how to write a constructor and a destructor for classes and they are actually functions, so the rules are the same for functions as you've already seen. You have to declare it before you can use it and you typically declare it in a header file that can be included in all the different places that might call the function. You just implement them once, in an implementation file, typically with the extension .cpp and you add that .cpp file into your project in Visual Studio, so that everything will be complied and linked together into the executable. A function that's part of a class like constructors and destructors are called member functions. In C++, you can also write functions that are not part of any class. People sometimes call them global functions, but a better name for them is free functions and there's very little difference between them, both in the rules when you write them, and declare them, and even when you call them. When you call a member function you use the . syntax and when you call a free function you don't, that's about it. A function takes parameters optionally, some functions don't take any and it can take them by value or by reference. When parameters are taken by value, the compiler actually makes a copy of whatever you're passing down to give to the function to work with and any changes the function makes are strictly local and are thrown away when the function ends. When you pass by reference, the compiler gives the function access to the actual information, the actual address that you chose to pass, and any changes that you make in the function are reflected back in the calling code, and I'll have a demo to show you that. You can also return either nothing at all, we don't have a subroutine in C++ we just have a function that doesn't return anything or a value, or a reference and when you return by value, copies are made. Copies in C++ can potentially be expensive and this is why we sometimes like to take parameters by reference or to return them by reference, however, when you return by reference you have to make sure that you don't create what's know as a dangling reference and again that something that I'll demonstrate.\n",

      "I'll start with the demo of some free functions. Here I have a console application, just like all these other console applications, and I've taken the logic for determining whether something was prime or not and moved it off into a little helper function called is prime. You can probably guess that it's declared in Utility.h because here's Utility.h, but just to show you how Visual Studio can help you out, I can right click on this function and Go to the Declaration or the Definition of the function. If I choose Go to Declaration you can see here in Utility.h the declaration of the function, it just says there's this function called IsPrime, it takes an integer, and it returns a Boolean. It doesn't tell you the actual code for it, that would be the implementation. I can now right click either back in original functions or here and choose Go to Definition instead of Go to Declaration and that opens Utility.cpp where the actual implementation of function. The code for it, it's the for loop from the for demo and it simple returns prime instead of setting a variable the way the old code did. So this takes an integer, figures out whether it's prime or not, and returns true or false. Now it has a side effect that it prints on the screen, it's not normal behavior for a function, but this is a demo it's nice for you to see what's going on, so I left it in there. We go back into our Main, you can see that we say if IsPrime at x, so that's going to pass x by value down to function which will return by value true or false back. If I got true back, I'll print out that it's prime, if I got false back I'll print out that it's not prime. I have a second function called Is2MorePrime and as you can probably guess by looking at the print outs, it takes x adds 2 to it and sees if that is prime or not. Why would I write a function like that? Well, I have my reasons. First, here's the declaration in Utility.h is Is2MorePrime, takes an integer x and here's the code for it. It makes x 2 larger than it currently is and then passes that down to IsPrime and I wanted to show you this C++ way of thinking. You don't sort of say Bool 2MoreIsPrime is = to false, 2MoreIsPrime is = to IsPrime at x and heaven help us, if 2MoreIsPrime is true return true else return false. You know IsPrime returns a Bool we can just return that ourselves and this sort of chaining up, is a really common behavior in little helper functions. So return IsPrime at x will call IsPrime passing in the new larger value of x and get back to our false which will then immediately be returned by Is2MorePrime. I could have called this whole thing a single line return IsPrime x+2, but I have a second thing I want to show with this function and that's why it's split out twice. So I'm going to Run it so you can watch it work and let's try 7. 7 is prime, but as part of processing 7+2 which is 9, we found a factor 3 and so it prints out 7+2 is not prime. This is all good, it's correct behavior. Now notice that Is2MorePrime changed the value of x to x+2, but when we came back to the calling code and printed out x it still had the value of 7 and everybody kind of expected that and that was because x was being passed by value. I'm going to show you how to pass by reference just so that you see the difference. I have to change here and say that Is2MorePrime takes an integer reference that's a capital 7 if you're not in the habit of typing them and that Utility.cpp I have to change in the implementation that it takes an integer reference. What this means is that the code in Is2MorePrime will actually be working with the same memory slot for x that this guy is. Not because they have same name, but because it's a reference and so that when it changes it it will be changing this x and you'll see that if I Run it if I again enter 7, it correctly finds the factor, it's clearly working with 9, but when we come back it says 9+2 is not prime, which by coincidence 9+2 makes 11, which is prime, but that's not the point, it was testing 9. The reason it's saying 9+2 is because it's actually permanently changed x and is now printing out 9 for x. In this particular case, we don't want to pass x by reference. I wanted to show you the consequences of doing it, I'll just build that, but there are times when you do and there are two times when you want to pass a variable by reference. One is when you want the function to actually change it. For example, people who write string code, very often want to take a string and maybe capitalize it or change all e's to w's or whatever and they want to sort of take the string and call this function on it and have the string end up being changed. The other time you would use pass by reference is when the copy is really expensive, when you're passing some really large thing and you just don't want to pay for the cost of copying it and then you can use a reference and there is actually a way to tell the compiler, well yes I am going to take it by reference, but I promise I won't change it and that will save you from these kinds of accidental mistakes. We'll be talking about that const, keyword a little later, I just want you to know for now that it exists. Now I have one more thing going on in here and it's commented out because it is bad and I'm going to uncomment it out so that you can see what's bad about it. So I have a function here called BadFunction, which returns and integer reference and I have the code for it here. I'm using the comment and uncomment buttons in Visual C++ Express, which are super handy for this kind of thing. It declares this local variable a and returns a reference to a which is to access to the memory and then when we hit this brace bracket, a goes out of scope and this is what we call a dangling reference and code that tries to call a BadFunction and use the return value from it, may mostly work, but then on other occasions it won't work and that's why dangling references can be hard to spot because they don't always fail. They sort of tend to fail when other code writes over that same address and so you say, wow the value of my variable changed without me changing it. That's usually caused by problems like a dangling reference. Compiler as I said on many occasions is your friend. If I just build this using the keystrokes, it's got a warning here, let's scroll along, returning address of local variable or temporary. If you see that warning you know you're being warned about a dangling reference and you shouldn't do that. In this particular case, there's no real reason why this shouldn't just return an integer, integers are cheap to copy. If you had a different problem there are ways to return references to things that have longer lifetimes, we just haven't covered that yet, so it could be possibly correct to return a reference, but never just a reference to a local variable like a here which you just declared and then it's going to go out of scope when it hits the brace bracket.\n",

You can see like just with the constructors, it's added in here in the public section and if I right click Go to Definition and see the code for GetName, it returns the first name then a space and then the last name and I've actually changed the constructor and destructor to use this function. If you remember Person and Tweeter have printouts in their constructor and destructor so that we can learn a little bit about the scope of objects that are constructed on the stack. Using this function GetName instead of firstname and then a space and then lastname, means first of all our code is shorter. These statements used to have to span two lines in the file, now they're just a single line, but also gives us great consistency. If this was a real application with real work to do and someone said, wow I hate that you print out firstname lastname, it really should be lastname, firstname. The old way we would had to go in and change it in a bunch of places and hope we caught them all, now we can just go change the code for GetName and everybody's using GetName. So this is one of the ways that encapsulating things up into functions can save you work. Refactoring is always a good plan, code duplication always a bad plan. Here inside Person, we can just call the function just as its name GetName, it's of course the Person GetName and it's for the particular we're working on. So when we're constructing p1 and we call GetName it's going to use the member variables, the first, last, and arbitrary number of the p1 person. You can also just take an instance of a class, an object, and tell it you want to use one of its functions and that's what happens in the main here, we can call p1.GetName and that's how we call the function. Now I have some other functions in Person.h that are implemented a little bit differently. These are almost like properties, C++ doesn't support properties, but you're welcome to write functions whose names start with Get or Set according to the capitalization strategy that your team is providing, I'm using capital letters throughout rather than camelcasing, it's your call and these two functions GetNumber and SetNumber are inline functions. That's what we call it when the code for them is right here in the header file and nowhere to be found in the implementation file. So I'm going to scroll around in here, there's no person:: GetNumber or person:: SetNumber they're implemented here in the header file. Implementing in the header file, if you find old enough material they'll tell you that makes it faster. Being an inline function makes it faster and the compiler decides whether something is an inline function or not and can inline really short functions even if they're in the cpp file. However, putting them in here makes it obvious to anyone who reads your code and remember, everybody has to be able to read your header, exactly what these two functions do. In the case of something like a property, which is really completely transparent, there's no validation, there's no business rules, nothing, you're fine with everybody knowing it. In the case of a real function that does real work, you wouldn't want it in the header file being compiled over and over again into every file that included it. It's find for something like GetNumber and SetNumber. Now notice you can't tell when people are using the functions how they're implemented. Here I have a call to GetName and GetNumber right after each other and there's no visible difference between them and nor should there be. The point is that person has a GetName function and it has a GetNumber function, neither one of them take any parameters, fine. So GetName returns a string, you can see that here and GetNumber returns an integer, you can see that here, and don't forget that Visual Studio will tell you that. So if I hover it says std::string Person::GetName and int Person::GetNumber. Here I'm also calling SetNumber. Let me show you setNumber it's also inline and I wanted to show you the return type which is void. Constructors and destructors don't have a return type, there's nothing before their name. Every other kind of function, every free function and every member function that's not a constructor or a destructor has a return type, but if it's sort of subroutinish and doesn't have anything to return, we say that it returns void. Void's not technically a type, it's a keyword that belongs where types go to say, I'm not an idiot, I didn't forget, I want to say nothing an absence of information. Some people type void inside the round brackets when they're declaring a function that doesn't take any parameters, you don't need to, so I don't, but if you see it there, that's what they're doing. So SetNumber takes an integer number and doesn't return anything and here we're calling it to change the value of arbitrary number for this person, p1, and then I'm immediately going to call GetName and GetNumber again, so that I can see that I successfully changed the value from 123 as we constructed it at, to 124. So this demo shows you calling a member function from within another member function. When you don't have any decoration you just say the name of the function you want to call and calling a member function on an instance of the class using this . notation. So let's see it all happen. And we still have the same code in the constructor as before and one of things that this shows you, remember that someone else, is a Tweeter, which inherits from Person and here when is says constructing Someone Else, before constructing the Tweeter object it constructs a person object and it can still use GetName because GetName is a person function and that works out just fine. Anyway, and then our Tweeter goes out of scope and we're down here where it says p1 and we call Name and Number I'm set to 123 then we use SetNumber and it comes out 124 and then finally, p1 goes out of scope and is destructed. All of the rules that you just learned for free functions about taking your parameters by reference or by value, about returning things by reference or by values still apply to member functions. What I find very common with member functions is that they perhaps don't take any parameters because they work entirely on member variables of the class or that they don't return a value because they keep their answer in a member variable of the class. That's what you see with GetNumber and SetNumber. It doesn't need to take any parameters because it can use the member variable arbitrarynumber and it doesn't need to return anything when you SetNumber because it's keeping the result in arbitrarynumber, which is this member variable of our class and that pattern's really common in member functions. Also member functions can be inline, as you see here and that improves readability and like all inlining whether it's triggered by this or by some of the other ways you can inline including the compiler just choosing too, it also improves performance. C++ is all about performance and calling a function has a little bit of overhead in it. Inlining is something the compiler does to take that overhead away.\n",

      "Now it all looks fine when someone just shows it to you. Here is a function being declared, here is a function being implemented, here is a function being called. Then you get out in the wild and you try to do this yourself and I find often people are really frustrated by the error messages that they get and the reason for their frustration is that in C++ calling and using a function requires passing two different checks. Sometimes people are getting message from one check and trying to fix something that only the other check cares about. It's not going to make the error message go away. Specifically, you have to make the complier happy, as well as the linker happy. The compiler only cares that you declared the function, that's usually in a header file. If you've told the complier, there is a function called, in the case of our free function demo, IsPrime and it takes an integer, then that will get you no compiler error messages as long as you're calling IsPrime and passing in an integer, but if you don't implement the function, the linker says I can't find the implementation code for this to link in. Sometimes people are getting linker error messages and they go and try to change things in a header file, that's only about the compiler and it's not going to solve your error message. The easiest way to internalize which error messages are caused by which mistakes is to deliberately make a series of mistakes and check and see what error messages you get for them and so that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to use the classes and objects example from the previous demo and deliberately mess up in it a little bit. So, let's start with getting the name of the function when you're calling it. So it's declared properly, implemented properly, I'll use get name as an example and I'll just accidently type the wrong thing and then if I Build the project, I get this error, GetNameX is not a member of Person. If I double click the error, it repeats the message down here and I can look and see the problem is indeed I've typed the name of the function wrong. That's easy enough to fix and also I got red wiggles for it, class Person has no member GetNameX, so I'll fix that. Our next possible mistake is that I've got the name correct, but I've either used the wrong number parameters or the wrong type. Let's go back here and what if I try to pass a number down to GetName. We don't have a version of GetName that takes a number. You see I get red wiggles, too many arguments in function call. If I compile anyway, function does not take 1 arguments. Pluralization bugs are fun, aren't they? Now this applies to also not passing enough arguments or passing the wrong type. So if come down here to SetNumber and I pass in string instead of a number, it says that the argument is incompatible. If I build it anyway, so you can see that error message, cannot convert parameter 1, this is actually C++ talk for that quote string to int and usually that's all the hint you need that oh yeah, this is supposed to take an integer not a string and you can fix your problem. Sometimes, you call it properly, you implement properly, but you mess up when you declare it. So I'll just put a name change, put an x in the name and we'll build this. So it's correct in the calling code. It's correct in the implementing code here in Person.cpp, but the mistake is in the header file. Now you notice what happens, I'm getting a very large number of error messages. For one typo, I'm getting a lot of different error messages and here's why. These first clump are when I'm compiling that main ClassesandOjects.cpp. ClassesandObjects.cpp tries to call GetName twice and the error messages are saying there is no GetName. Now there's an implementation of GetName in the .cpp file, but ClassesandObjects when it's being compiled, the compiler just looks at what's in the header file Person.h and there's no GetName in the Person.h and so we get a pair of error messages for the correct lines here, this should be right, but because of the error in the header file, we're given sort of a false positive error here in our main. What's more, when we're compiling Person.cpp and we're trying to implement GetName, it gives us a series of different complaints. First it says, GetName I don't know what you're talking about and it says that here when we try to call it in the constructor and the destructor, but it also says it here when we try to implement it. Plus, it says here, what do you mean firstname, what do mean lastname because as far as the complier is concerned this function GetName isn't part of Person and if it isn't part of Person, it doesn't have access to Person's member variables. So we have this just boat load of error messages all because the compiler doesn't believe that GetName is part of Person and so making typos in header files can have dramatic consequences. Every single file that includes the header file is now going to have some sort of compiler errors and their often going to be these cascades of errors which say, I don't know what you're talking about plus that's not a member variable you can't talk to it because you're not part of the class, plus this other code that tries to call the function is going to get errors and when you fix your one character mistake and rebuild, dozens of error messages disappear. A good rule of thumb for C++ developers, when you get a lot of error messages all at once, just fix the first one and then build again because sometimes it'll make a great number of them go away and that's especially true when the mistake is a mistake in the header file. Now what if I make a mistake when I'm implementing that function? So it's declared properly as GetName and it's called properly as GetName, but I go in here and I just, you know I'm having a bad day, and I type the name wrong. I could as easily type the number of parameters wrong or the types of parameters, doesn't matter, you can see right away I'm getting red wiggles and this is because in the header I said that there was a GetName function, I didn't say there was a GetNamex function and so just as you saw when the mistake was in the header, this implementation file is like you're not a member function of person, I don't know what you're talking about and why you think you're allowed to look at firstname and lastname and you get that big clump, the same clump of error messages as when the mistake was in the header file. What if I just flat out forget to implement the function? You declared it in the header file and you forgot that you needed to implement it. Especially if you have some functions that are inline, the way GetNumber and SetNumber are, you might type a whole pile of functions in here and just forget you needed to over and implement GetName. This is a problem that trips people up because the compiler is going to be perfectly happy. The compiler when it's compiling says ClassesandObjects, you notice there's no red wiggles here, GetName is declared in Person.h, but when we Build these are linker errors and the first linker errors that you'll have seen from me so far. In fact if you really care, you notice that the error starts LNK. When you see a linker error, you always look not for a problem in a header file, but for missing implementations. So the key part of messages it says, unresolved external symbol, something is missing that it was expecting to be able to find. Now because we're working with strings, this is unfortunate, you sometimes get really nasty error messages when you're using strings, we'll just skip over all of that. Here's the important part, Person::GetName. So it's telling you what is missing and then there's some more decoration which has to do with how overloads are implemented. Linker error messages reveal a lot of the insides of C++, but you can skip over all that and get to where it turns into English again referenced in function_wmain, which is what we call it tmain here, but there's a preprocessor thing that turns in into wmain, that's not terribly vital. The key is, in amongst all the gibberish, this error message says to you, you said there would be a GetName and now I can't find it and when you get that error message from the linker, as opposed to the compiler, it's because you forgot to implement the function. So we quickly implement it, Build it, and we're back to the races again. What about I wrote it, I implemented it, but I forgot to include the right header file? That one's the most common mistake actually. Let's comment out this include of Tweeter and Build. Here the errors are only in ClassesAndObjects. When you have a mistake in a header file, you get complaints from ever place that includes that header file. When you forget a header file, you only get the complaints in the place you forgot it. So here it says Tweeter undeclared identifier and then we have a cascade of errors. It goes on to say, well if I don't know what Tweeter is then this syntax is really strange I don't know why you've got round brackets and commas and things, this isn't right and I don't know what t1 is, I'm going to throw this whole line away, so then a little later it will try to object if you try to talk to t1 because it wasn't properly declared or it doesn't know its type. The real hallmark you're forgetting and include is that the errors are only in the file that the include was forgotten in. When the errors are in multiple files, they're caused by a mistake in the header that's been included into multiple files. So let's make that right again. Let's forget the header in the implementation file now. So if I go into Person.cpp because I happen to have it open, scroll up to the top, and forget to include Person.h. Now when this is being complied, I'm declaring all these member functions in the person class. In fact, I'm even declaring the fact that there is a Person class in a file that's not being included into here and as you can see from all the red wiggles, in here they're like why are trying to talk about Person. anything that's got :: after it has to be a class name. This is your clue that the complier doesn't think Person is a class name and here, it says I don't know what GetName is and GetName is a member of function of Person, but the compiler no long knows that because you didn't include it here in the implementation file. So if I build it, tons of errors, all coming from Person.cpp and basically starting with this one, Person is not a class or namespace name. The rest of these kind of cascade from that. You notice eventually it does give up, it says wow, you are so messed up I'm going to stop even trying to figure out what you mean and that's a good sign. You don't work your way up from the bottom or pick one of these things in the middle and try and fix it, you start with the first error, Person is not a class or namespace name, well I declared the Person to be a class over in Person.h, I forgot to include Person.h, fix it up, build it and all the errors go away. Finally, one that's not very likely to happen as long as you're following along the way I told you how to add classes into your project, but that can trip you up, so I'll show it to you. When you look in this project, we have files over here in the Solution Explorer. When this project was built, it was built two different ways, one by right click, Add, a Class, which added a cpp and an h file at the same time and one by right click Add, New Item twice, once by choosing cpp file and once choosing header file and both of these approaches add the cpp file to the project. It doesn't much matter whether a header file is included in the project or not, but it really matters that an implementation is added to the project. If you right click any of these file tabs, you can choose Open Containing Folder and in here you will see the cpp files and the h files all mixed together and you could, if you wanted to, right click and Create a File here, typically people would create a Text Document and then rename it with a different extension, and that would add a file to this folder, but it wouldn't add the file to the project. Sometimes people give you code, and you just put it in the folder and if you forget to add it to the project the includes will work because includes follow a path and just look on that path for a file with that name, but the linking will not because unless the cpp file is explicitly added to the project, it won't be linked into the project. So to simulate forgetting to add, I'm going to remove a file from the project and I'm going to remove Tweeter.cpp with this Exclude From Project. Now you see that it disappears from here, it's still in the folder, nothing's happened to the actual file and if I Build this again we're getting linker errors, they start LNK unresolved external symbol and it's actually complaining about two different things, one is the destructor and the other is the constructor of Tweeter. They're both caused because the cpp file, Tweeter.cpp, is no long being linked into the project. Now, as long as you always add new material by right clicking your project and choosing Add, you will get things added to your project because you're busy adding them to your project. Should it ever happen that someone gives you a file of code and especially if you then get an error like this, we'll say, I've got to add it to the project, you can choose to Add Existing Item. It'll start by default looking right in the folder with the rest of your code. There's Tweeter.cpp and get it Added back into the project, shows up here, and I can Build and the Build succeeds. Should it happen that you get linker errors and you're sure the code is in the file, the next step is, is the linker including the file and the way to test that is to look over here in Solution Explorer and make sure that the cpp file really is in the project and not just in the solution that the project is part of. Now you've seen the full spectrum of mistakes a person can make when their working with functions whether you make a mistake calling it, declaring it, or implementing it. You've seen the difference between compiler error messages and linker error messages. You understand that sometimes you get dozens of error messages from a single character mistake and that noticing whether your error messages come all from the same file or from a variety of different files, is an excellent way to zero in on exactly where you're problem is. I hope this makes the process of fixing error messages a lot less frustrating for you.\n",

      "I mentioned it's very non C++ to say if x = true return true else return false, you would just say return x and similarly, certain kinds of constructs around if's where all you're doing is setting the value of a single variable, they set some C++ developers teeth on edge and they prefer to use an immediate if. So this isn't wrong. If whatever result = 7 else result = 302, the complier will like it, it'll execute just fine there's no speed hit from doing it, but many people prefer to use this notation, result = something?, that's how you're supposed to pronounce it, 7 and then the : you can pronounce else 302. These mean exactly the same thing. If something evaluates to true, result will get set to 7. If something evaluates to false, result will get set to 302 and it just takes a single line instead of four lines to get your expression across. There's not constraints on what you can put in there. You could say 7, but you could also call something along function. You can say 302, but you could again call some big long function if calculations whatever you want. As a best practice, it's more readable if at least one of them is just a simple literal, but you can use the same kinds of things that you could use if you wrote it out the long way, it's simply a matter of syntax.\n",

      "A simple demo for an immediate if. To make it not entirely trivial, I also thought I'd show you another idiom for the let's keep going until someone enters their signal value to quit. I showed you before with the switch, we first prompted the person, enter a number, then we went into the loop, and then we did the prompting again at the bottom of the loop. The other possibility is to put the prompting in the loop, then you have to initialize the variable to what we call a signal value. Something that will make sure you go into the loop. So here, we're setting x=99 and then saying while > 0, which of course it will be for sure the first time. Then we can go through and process our number. There are some other ways to move the test to the end, but you'll see this pattern fairly often and sometimes people are confused they're like you set it 99 and then you immediately check whether it was > 0, of course it's > 0, yes, but you'll be guaranteed they'll be some code inside the loop that will change it and that way you're going to go into that loop at least once, but you don't know how many times. That's the while part. Here's the immediate if part. Here's the ?. So we're declaring a string which we're calling sign and we're giving it the value all in this single line of code. We're saying, is x>0? And you don't pronounce it, that's what the ? is supposed to help you do. Is x>0? If it is, sign will end up saying positive if it's not then sign will end up saying 0 or negative. Then we're just going to print out your number is and that string variable sign. Easy enough, let's run this one a couple times So if I say 55, you're number is positive. Excellent. -11, your number is 0 or negative and then it's done It's a very simple little thing. Mostly what it is, is people say what, where did this ? or why is there are : in the middle of this statement, now you know that's an immediate if.\n",

      "C++ Flow of Control expressions really aren't that complicated, but you can build really complicated applications out of them. The existence of an if of a loop of some kind, that's common throughout languages. Maybe different languages call them different things, but they all pretty much exist. If you are muddled up a little bit on where do the brace brackets go, how come sometimes I have to have them and sometimes I don't? Remember the compiler is your friend. So in the for loop, the three parts are separated with semicolon. If you separate them with something else, you'll get message saying that some of them are missing. You'll have to interpret that, that because I don't have semicolon's it thinks this is all just the initializer and it's yelling me about the other pieces no being there. Typically, commas is what people do wrong there. Switch your commas to semicolons and your error messages will go away. Same if you leave out your braces or some other part of the syntax of your switch statement. You can build a for loop with a while. You say that they were pretty much interchangeable. You can build a switch out of a bunch of if's and else's. You can certainly build an immediate if out of an if and an else, and in fact, especially if you were to drag the dreaded goto into the mix, you could get by without anyone of them replacing them with the other instead. So use them in the way that's most readable, and in the way that most C++ developers use them. So for example, if you know how many time you're going to go through a loop, you should use for. For int i=0, i < 10 increment i by 1, that's just a common or guarded loop. You can do it with a while, but people would think you were kind of strange. When you don't know how many time you're going to through in advance because you're processing a whole file or you're keeping going until the user presses 0, use a while. The complier couldn't care less what you use, but humans who read your code do. Should you use a switch or a bunch of if's, assume there's just more than three possibilities or even really three go with the switch. If there's just two, don't make a switch for just two, that's kind of weird, that's like an if and it's else. You don't need that. Should you use an immediate if? Well the minute your immediate if has to spend multiple lines, you're probably doing it wrong. The whole point of the immediate if is it took that for line construct and turned it into a one line construct. If your conditions and your values that you're setting the variable to are so long that the whole thing has to be broken up with line breaks, it should probably be a regular if. We also talked about functions, about free functions and member functions. Taking parameters by values or by reference and return by value or by reference. The demos I've showed you where all the parameters are return types are things like integers, you know what, just always do it by value, but there will be times when taking by reference is appropriate and you've seen the syntax now that capital 7 that & after the type integer reference. You can also have string reference, or person reference, we just didn't happen to demo them. Functions are what your application is built up, functions and classes. Your functions are built out of these Flow of Control constructs, out of loops, out of conditionals, out of checking to see if something is found or done, or good enough, or needs special handling. You're almost complete versed in all of the C++ syntax and ready to start putting this all into action.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language, C++. In this module you'll meet the rather amazing number of operators that C++ has for performing arithmetic, comparing, and so on. There are some pitfalls waiting for you and I'll show you what often trips up beginners to C++. You'll also learn how your own classes can get in on the operator story by writing your own overloads of common operators for your code.\n",

      "Most applications perform calculations of some kind. They add, multiply, and divide numbers and C++ has the operators you'd expect to do that. Hopefully no one's really surprised to see this list, but one of the interesting things about C++, and this goes back to its C heritage, is that it has operators that other languages may or may not have and the reason that they are in C++ is because they are a single instruction on some of the chips the language was designed to run on. The plus equals and minus equals operators are actually quicker, in the absence of an optimizer of course, than the long way. X+=2 and X is equal to X+2 are the same in terms of the answer you get, but in a time before optimizers X+=2 could actually be quicker. These days the issue isn't about the performance, but it is about readability and about typo prevention. If your variable's not called X, it's called number of units that I need to ship, then being able to write += amount in new order is shorter line of text and less chance to make mistakes than if you have to repeat that really long variable name a couple of times. If you want to add just one or take away just one there is also the increment operator, and there are two variants of each of the increment and decrement, and they're known as prefix and postfix depending on whether the symbol comes before or after the variable that you're incrementing or decrementing. The difference between them has to do with what this operator returns. You know all operators have a return value, so 2 + 3 returns 5. In C++ even the equals operator has a return value. If I write X = 2 that expression actually returns the value 2. i++ returns the old value of i and then increments it, whereas ++i increments i and then returns the new value and the same for the decrement. i-- returns the old value of i and then decrements it; --i decrements i and then returns the new smaller value. Why would anybody care about this distinction or even want this operator? I'll show you that when we get to the demo. The percent symbol is the modulo operator. That's your remainder after you divide things so in this example here 17 divided by 2 is 8 remainder 1 and the modulo 17 % 2 is 1, that remainder that's left over after you divide. Quite often you'll see people testing modules against 0 as a quick way of showing whether or not something is a multiple of the smaller number. The one operator that seems to be missing is the exponent operator, no X to the power of Y. You can't invent your own. You have to settle for using the pow function, which is in math.h. One of the reasons you can't invent your own has to do with the order of operations. C++ knows the rules that you probably learned in grade school about order of operations, so if somebody writes 3 * 2 + 1, you're supposed to do 3 * 2 first and then add 1 to the result. I don't recommend learning them. I recommend you use round brackets to gather things up because even if you learn them all, does the person who's going to read your code know them all? It's often a good idea to express your intent really clearly with brackets. I tell people brackets are free, and they really make sure that everybody understands the order of operations for these calculations that you're doing.\n",

      "I have a project with some simple code in it to demonstrate these operators. Now I don't have any classes in here. This is just some relatively artificial code just so that you can see how they all work, and hopefully none of them are any great surprise. I'm going to just run the project and show you the output next to the code that produced it. We do a number of things to i and just keep printing it out. We start out with i=0, prints out as 0. Then we use the += operator to add 2 to it, becomes 2. We use the *= operator to multiply by 3, becomes 6. We use the -= operator to take 2 off of it, becomes 4 and we use the /= operator to divide it by 4 and it becomes 1. I don't have any demo of, you know, plus, minus, times, and divide, but I thought I'd show you these four convenience operators. Now let's scroll down a little and take a look at the increment and decrement behavior. You can see I'm using all four of them here. I'm going to start by setting j = i++ and then I print out i and j. Because i++ returns the old value, which is 1, j is 1, but i has been incremented to 2. When I go ++i they both come out as 3, so the 2 is incremented to 3 and then that's what we return. j = i--, j stays at 3 and then i is decremented to 2, and finally, j --i, the 2 gets decremented down to 1 and then they both get the value of 1. Those lines of code that we've just gone through, they're really artificial. Why would you write int i = 2 and then add 3 to it or what have you. It doesn't mean anything. Here's an actual use of the increment operator, kind of semi-realistic. I'm going to run a loop. I'm going to start i = 2, and go while it's less than 101, and have just a single line in my while, which is that I'm going to call IsPrime, and I'm going to call IsPrime with the current value of i and then I'm going to increment i, so in this single line I'm able to run around the loop from 2 up to 101. I've taken this function IsPrime, which you may remember from other demos. It returns true or false whether the number is prime, and if it returns true -- I'm using an immediate if -- I'm going to add 1 to j. If it returns false I'm going to add 0 to j, so I'm counting how many prime numbers there are between 2 and 100. 101 is not strictly less than 101, so we'll stop after we've processed 100. When this runs it claims there are 25 primes and you're welcome to count on your fingers and establish whether that's correct or not. The real purpose of the code is to show you an actual use for the increment operator and for it being important whether I called i++ or ++i. If I were to call this with ++i the first number that would get passed down to IsPrime would be 3 not 2 because we'd increment it and then call it. We'd actually get a different result when we ran this.\n",

      "When I covered the syntax for if, while, and for we were pretty repetitive in terms of the condition that went in those brackets. Very often we're just comparing that X was greater than something, because I didn't feel like explaining all the different comparison operators, so now let's do that just for the sake of completeness. We have, or course, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. Hopefully those are familiar from other languages. Not equal to in C++ is != and the exclamation mark in general is a not -- I'll show you that shortly -- and equal to, super important, two equal signs. A single one means that you are assigning a value, two when you are comparing. You can combine your comparisons with the and and or operators. Boolean and and Boolean or, which are always spelled, if you will, with the double character, so two capital sevens or two or bars to get a Boolean and or Boolean or. Now the Boolean and ors are what we call shortcutting operators, so the sample you see here we say, if x and foo edx, if x is false there is no way for this expression to work out true. False and anything is always going to come out false and C++, which is all about power and efficiency and everything else, will not evaluate the other half of the expression. It can't be important. No matter what it is the thing's going to come out to false and so we say it's a shortcutting operator, foo will not get called. This may or may not matter from a performance point of view, but if foo has any side-effects this is super important. It's super important that you don't think foo always gets called, but also, this is a popular idiom to protect bad things happening. If foo is some function that will blow up when you pass false to it, this will guarantee that it will never be passed false. That may seem silly, why would you write a function that blows up when you pass false to it, but remember that 0 matches false, everything else matches true and it's quite likely to write functions that blow up when they're past 0 and this is a way to protect that function from being called. You also have shortcutting like this with the or. If the first one is true it doesn't matter what the second one is, true or anything will come out true and again, it won't call the second one, but it's more common to see as an idiom the protection with a and. They both shortcut however. The not operator, as I mentioned, is the exclamation mark. You can use this just to negate something you already have. So you could say if not X -- you can write weird stuff like if not brackets X is less than 3, but it would make more sense to rewrite that using the greater than or greater than or equal to operators, but you'll quite often see it for functions that return true or false using not to flip around the return value from that function.\n",

      "I have another very trivial demo just to show what happens and what sometimes people get confused by. We have this local i and I'm going to test to see if it's 3 or not, and if it is I'm going to print out that i is 3. You would expect when I run this that this would not print out that i is 3. Then, I'm going to print out the value of i again, you'll see that it's 2, and we're going to test again, but here I'm making a \"mistake\" of using a single equal sign rather than a double. If this returns true I'll print out that i is 3 and then I'll deliberately set it equal to 4, hoping then for a failed comparison, and now here I have a kind of a backwards comparison. People sometimes call this Yoda syntax and I'm comparing 3 to i instead of i to 3, either way it should come out false, so we should expect not to see i is 3. Let's run this (Typing). I'll just put the output next to the code. We'll see we start out and i is not equal to 3, so we don't print this line out. The first thing we print out is that i is 2. The next thing that happens is that suddenly we're told, yep i is 3. The reason is that this i = 3 line actually assigns the value 3 to i. Compiler does exactly as it's told, puts the value 3 into i. The equals operation returns 3, the value we just put into i, and since 3 isn't 0 that's converted to Boolean true, the if succeeds and the statement i = 3 prints out. Here we pump out the value of i again, to confirm that sure enough, it is 3, and we deliberately set it to 4, and testing here it doesn't print out i = 3. When printed out the value is still 4. Well why would anybody write their ifs this way, 3==i? The answer is what happens when you make this mistake. Here, when I make this mistake, I still get valid C++ code. This is actually something that happens quite often in real code on purpose. But here if I take away one of the equal signs, you can't set the number 3 to a new value, so you get a compiler error, and people who are fans of the Yoda syntax are trying to prevent themselves from this error by using their syntax in this order so that if they ever just forget and type a single equal sign that they'll get helped by the compiler. Let me just show you. I said this is something people would actually really do, have a single equal sign and an if. I'm going to type some kind of gibberish code and it calls some non-existent functions and prove to you how people might do this. Something you might do, you might declare another integer (Typing), call some function passing in a string, and then if that p is not 0 do something, call some other function (Typing). Let's just make this true-ish, at least keep the compiler happy, by just declaring some functions. I'm going to have an integer foo that takes a string s and in order for that to work I have to include string (Typing), and another integer function called something that doesn't take any parameters. I'm not going to implement these, but simply by declaring them this way I take away any red wigglies and make it clear to everybody that the compiler is okay with this code. Now let's make it a little nicer. Let's put the braces here no matter what, so that if we add more into what we're going to do when p is not 0 that we won't get messed up by thinking the compiler might read our indents. This is working code. The compiler will compile. It'll run, assuming I were to have the functions foo and something written, but it's not kind of C++ish. The first thing is to take this away (Typing). It's very non C++ish to write if whatever equals true or if whatever is not 0 because they're the same as just if whatever, so when I say if p that will come out as false if p is 0, otherwise it'll come out true, so if p and if p are not equal to 0 exactly the same. This is the more C++ way to do it and the really more C++ way to do it is to take this assignment and put it here. Now I am in the one breath, assigning p to the result of the function call and checking the result of the function call. If it's nonzero we'll do something, if it's zero we won't, and this is a C++ idiom that happens all of the time. And for the compiler to warn you when you did this and say, oh are you sure, did you really mean to type only one equal sign? would mess this idiom up, so as a result, there is no warnings, you see there's no red wigglies, and if I were to build this I would only get linker errors because I haven't actually implemented those functions, but I wouldn't get any compiler errors at all. I'm going to take this code and just comment it out (Typing) and then uncomment some other code that I want you to see (Typing). This code is going to ask for a number and figure out if it's prime or not. We're going to use the IsPrime function that's been kicking around in a lot of different demos and the not operator. So IsPrime will return true when it's prime, not will turn that into false. It'll return false when it isn't prime and not-ing that will turn that into true, which in this case, will cause it to print out not, so it'll write out either 4 is not prime or 5 is prime, depending on the number that I enter. That's showing you combining the results of a function with the not operator right inside the if. I'm then going to ask for a second number, j, and I'm going to calculate i % j, that is the modulus, the remainder, after dividing i by j. If i is 5 and j is 2, 5 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. If the remainder is exactly 0 then they're multiples. Alright, so if I take 4 divided by 2 that has a remainder of 0, that's because 4 is a multiple of 2 and I've written this out the long way, saying if it's not 0 then it's not a multiple, but again, the more C++ way to do it would simply be to test i % j. If i % j is 0 that's false and we won't go into the if. If i % j is nonzero that's true and we will go into the if and print out the not. I'm going to run this code and try it with a couple different numbers. (Typing) Let's try 5 and 2 (Typing). 5 is not a multiple of 2. Hopefully not a surprise to anybody (Typing), run it again. This time I'll do 4 and 2 (Typing). 4 is a multiple of 2. Let me show you one other possibility. I'll try 5 again. This time I'm going to ask if it's a multiple of 0. (Typing) You see what happens; we sort of sit here, and then Windows says your program has a major problem and the major problem is that it's thrown a divide by 0 exception, which I could figure out if I were to click problem details and scroll through and take a look at the problem, but there's no way to solve it and I'm not going to submit details. We divided by 0 because I entered 0 for the second number, which is j. There are a variety of ways to cope with that. I could have put in a while loop that said, you know, while the person didn't enter 0, and if I do enter 0 I could put an error message, ask me again, and so on, and honestly, taking the modulus like this may not be the world's most common behavior, but there are plenty of functions out there that expect to get a number that is not 0 and passing 0 will make the function blow up. We can simulate that with this i % j calculation, and if I simply say here, if j && (Typing) i % j, what's going to happen is when j is 0, that's false. We shortcut. We won't calculate i % j. We won't throw the arithmetic exception. Now we also won't print out the word not, so this is going to have the consequence that everything can be a multiple of 0. If you don't like that mathematically you could write a slightly more complicated version of the expression here, but I'm okay with everything being a multiple of 0, so let's run this now and say 0 and watch it not blow up. (Typing) I'll say 5 for the first one again, 0 for the second one, and it reports that 5 is a multiple of 0. You may not like that mathematically, but what's important here is the application did not blow up and the reason it didn't blow up is that this line, which tried to divide by the second number, this expression was never evaluated, and it was never evaluated because the and is a shortcutting operator.\n",

      "A natural response the first time you see those Boolean and and or operators that are doubled up, two ampersands, two or bars is to ask why? Why do you need two of them? The natural mistake is to only use one. When you only use one you're using a bitwise operator, not a Boolean operator. I've mentioned a couple times, when you try to put an integer into an if, it gets converted to true or false -- 0 is false; everything else is true. So if I want to do 4 and 1, and imagine longer expressions, one of which evaluates to 4 and one of which evaluates to 1. That's true and true and that's true. Bitwise operators take the individual numbers, line them up as binary numbers, a series of 0's and 1's, and then and or, or in the case of the not operator, negate, flip the bid bit by bit. So, 4 in binary is 100; 1 in binary is 001. 100 bitwise _____anded with 001. We take the first pair, the topmost bit in each number, 1 and 0, 0. Move down to the middle one, 0 and 0 is 0, and the last one, 011, still 0, so we get a result of 000, which is false. So, 4 && 1 is using a Boolean operator, comes out true. 4 & 1 using the bitwise operator comes out 0, which is false, completely opposite result. Why would you want it? It's very common to save space and time by packing individual bit values into a single number. If you have some operation, which has got seven different options that you could set, you can take seven parameters, each of which is just true or false, or you can take a single integer and look at the lowest seven bits of that integer and see if they're on or off to see whether you want the option on or off. In other words, when someone passes in 4 they are saying that they want the particular option that corresponds to that bit position on and all the other options off. If they pass in 7, that means their number ends 111 in binary, they want those last three options on. Nobody works that out in their head and says, oh I think I'll pass in 13. Instead they use bitwise and an or to combine typically constants that match to those values, so there'll be a constant defined whose value is 4. There'll be another constant defined whose value is 1, another constant defined whose value is 8, and when you or them together you turn on the individual bits in the flag. When you want to test you bitwise and to look and see if those bits are on in that flag. Is this a beginner technique? No it is not. When you're calling those kind of functions someone'll give you sample code showing that you set the options by passing in the last parameter, abc or bar, only one of them, def or bar, ghi, where those letters represent individual constants. For example, if you're writing a message box call, there's an mb_OK and an mb_Cancel and if you or them together you want both an OK and a Cancel button, and the fact that it's bit-packed under the covers can be completely hidden from you. If you know the trick you'll see the single or bar and go, oh I get it, we're setting bits in an integer, but you don't really need to know. I consider it to be a non-beginner technique. It's really only something I need to mention to keep you from accidentally using it. You're always going to use the double ampersand Boolean and the double or bar or for your typical Boolean calculations. In the interest of completeness I'll also mention the bit shift operators. You've met these in their guise for putting input and output, but they actually existed first in the language as a bit shift technique where you write the number out in binary and then move all the bits over one direction or the other. Moving all of the bits leftwards is like multiplying the number by 2 because everybody moves up a power of 2, and moving all the bits rightwards is like dividing by a power of 2 and throwing away the remainder because all of the bits move down. Again, not a beginner technique, but if you happen to see people putting these operators with numbers on both sides of them it's not about writing to the screen or reading from the keyboard, it's about shifting bits around in a packed bit flag. It's almost never what you want to do if you're just getting started in C++. I'm not going to show you a bitwise demo. If you want to play around with these you're welcome to fire up a console app and put some of these in and see that the examples here on the screen are true and make some more up of your own if you're interested. Bit twiddling can have tremendous benefit. It can also be tremendous difficulty and there's some very fiddly, worrisome bits that I don't want to get into because in general it's not a beginner technique, not something you need to know in order to do effective work in C++ starting from day one.\n",

      "title: Operator Overloading\n",
      "nline: 33\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "Something I say a lot when I'm explaining C++ and how it's different from other languages is that the fundamental types and the user defined types are really on an equal footing. Operator overloading is one of the things that makes that true. You can write int i is equal to j + 3. You can also write Order newOrder is equal to oldOrder + newItem and plus, that fundamental operation of addition, can be something that makes sense for orders and items. This is overloading. To make it make sense, whoever wrote the order class has to write some code that says, here's how to add an item to an order, but you don't necessarily have to have a function called a-d-d add, you can use the much easier to spell and remember, plus sign, if you want to, as the way to add items to an order. Usually the function that you write is a member function, so in this case, the order developer would put something into the order class explaining how to add items into it. It's also possible that you could write a free function, that is a function not a member of any class, that takes two parameters: an order and an item. Why would you do that? Maybe if you were the item developer and you didn't have access to the order class to change it. The other reason that you'll see it is if the first item, the one before the operator, is not a class, but say an integer, something you can't change, then you have to write a free function to explain how to take three and add an item to it. Doesn't make any sense for items. There are cases where it may make sense. Now the Standard Library is rich in overloads that you've been using without seeing them. For example, the getName function in the person class that's been used in a number of these demos returns firstname + \" \" + lastname. We're using the plus operator to combine strings. Not because that's part of the language, the way it might be in some other languages, but because the plus operator has been overloaded by the author of the string class and they've written code that will add two strings together giving you a new string. You don't even see it. You just, you read the line of code; you know how it works; you don't even notice. The C in and C out using those double arrows turn out to be overloads of the bit shift operator and when we talk about the Standard Library in more detail and talk about things like collections, it's rich in overloads of, for example, the increment operator that you can use to move through a collection, moving onto the next and the next and the next. In addition to the arithmetic operators, you can overload the comparison operators, whether one order is greater than another, whether one date is less than another, whether one string is equal to another. You can even overload operators that most people don't realize are operators and in fact, think are part of the language and there's some very powerful and useful classes in the Standard Library that have overloaded these strange operators. We'll talk about them as we get to them, but you should know that essentially the whole language is at your feet through the power of operator overloading.\n",

      "title: Writing an Overload\n",
      "nline: 32\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "There are two ways to write an overload: as a member function of whatever type is before the operator and the function takes an instance of the type that's after the operator, or as a free function, it's not in any class, that takes two parameters, the first, the type that's before the operator, and the second, the type that's after it. When it's your class you should always try to write it the member function way, so if you've written some MyClass and you want to be able to say, is my object less than some other thing? Is this order less than a different order? You write a function called operator< and if you're writing an overload for operator plus or operator times or operator +=, all of which can be overloaded, then those are the names you give. The return type of the comparison operator is less than, less than or equal to, is equal to, is always Boolean true or false. The return type of the other operators is not a Boolean. For example, when I add two numbers I get a number. If I take a date and add a number to it I would expect to get a date. If I take two dates and subtract them I probably don't expect to get a date back right? I probably expect to get a number back, so you have to think about what the return types are. For the comparisons, it's Boolean, true or false. This is a member function of MyClass and the parameter that it takes is of type OtherType, whatever it is I'm going to compare to. If it makes sense to compare two dates, I might write an operator that just takes a date. If I am going to say is this order less than 100, then I guess I have to write an operator that takes an integer. Very common for the comparison operators that they just take the same type, so you compare two dates, compare two orders, compare two deals, but the compiler won't stop you from comparing a date to a string if you can figure out a smart way to do that. What about the case where you don't own the type that's before the operator? So something that you don't own -- could be an integer; nobody owns integer. Could be string, the Standard Library owns string, or could just be some other class within your system, but that you're not the developer of and you want to be able to say is something less than my object? You can't go into the other type class and add an operator less than, so you have to write a free function. Returns bool because this is operator<, returns true or false. Its name is still operator<, but notice it no longer has the full class name:: because it's not; it's just a free function; it's not in a class; and it takes two parameters. The first one is the type that's before the operator, the second is the type that's after the operator. Now this is not part of my class, so if it needs to get to any member variables of my class it's probably going to have to get at them through public functions. There is a way around that with something called friend, I'll show you it in the demo, but it's not your first choice. If there are public function's available, that's what you should use. It looks complicated when you try to write it out generically. It's actually really simple when you go to write one, so let me show you how.\n",

      "I've written some overloads of the comparison operator so that you can take a look at how they're actually coded. First though, I want you to see how they're used because it's pretty simple and intuitive. I've got two people here, p1 and p2, and if you remember how these objects work, they have a first name, a last name, and an arbitrarynumber, and these constructors are setting their arbitrary numbers to 123 and 456 respectively. Then I'm going to test whether or not p1 is less than p2 and if it's not I'm going to print out the word not, so this'll pump out either p1 is less than p2 or p1 is not less than p2. If we look at the values, if we're going alphabetically, k is before s in the alphabet. If we are going by numerical value of the arbitrarynumber, 123 is less than 456, so I'd expect this to print out p1 is less than p2. Now I'm going to compare p1 to a number, an integer, 300. That sort of tells us, just by reading the code, that it's probably the arbitrarynumber that's being compared. Pretty much the identical code, except this says 300 here instead of p2. Well 123 is less than 300, so I'm guessing to see that this would say p1 is less than 300, and then we flip it around and ask is 300 less than p1. This isn't just about getting the opposite answer, as you saw on the slide, this also means we actually get a different function called. When the compiler needs to deal with this line of code it's going to call a function, which is a member of the Person class, called operator<, that takes a person as its single argument. When it comes time to deal with this line of code it's going to call a member function of person, called operator<, that takes an integer for its single argument. When it needs to deal with this line of code it can't find a member function of integer, so it's going to look for a free function called operator<, that isn't in any class at all, whose first argument is an integer, and whose second argument is a person, and as the person developer you sort of have to cross your fingers that nobody else feels like writing that function. I've written those three and I've declared them all in person.h and implemented them all in person.cpp, so let me show them to you now. The two member functions, one that takes a person and one that takes an integer, are inside the person class. I've defined these as member functions of Person. Person class starts here, ends here, and these are public member functions. Now I decided to make this one take a Person reference rather than a person. When we were talking about functions and about passing by value versus passing by reference, it's a little quicker to pass by reference. In fact, there are a series of idioms and patterns that we use when we're writing operator overloads and we use references for a number of reasons, actually have a pattern to use const reference, but since we haven't talked about const yet I'm not going to bring that in, but I have written it to take a person reference, and this one takes an integer. The third function, same name, operator<, same return type, bool, but it takes two parameters, the integer first and then the person, and that's the one that's used in this comparison here. Now the three functions are all implemented in the Person.cpp class. There's no particular rule about where you have to put free functions. I would never take all my free functions from throughout my application and stick them all in one big file called functions. This overload, it may not be part of the Person class, but it should be maintained by the Person developer. It should be written by someone who knows how Person works, and it really belongs in Person.h because anyone who includes Person.h is probably going to need this function. Similarly, the code for it belongs in Person.cpp. We start with functions that you've seen before from the other demos using Person. Let's come down here to the new ones. This operator< is part of the Person class. We call it by its full name, Person:: and it takes a person reference and it just returns whether or not the arbitrarynumber of the person instance the method was called on, that is to say the guy before the operator, is less than the other guy's arbitrarynumber. You could add a more complicated application, but I have to tell you, when I look at comparison operators in the wild they're generally all like this. They're a single line long. They say, return whether the person's salary is greater than the other person's salary. Return whether or not the order total, how that compares to the other order's total or the ship date or the due date or some other single variable. Sometimes you might see a little tie-breaking or a tiny bit of a calculation, but it's common as dirt for these comparison operators to be just really one line of code. (Typing) The one that takes an integer, so we were saying if p1 is less than 300, just compares the member variable of the instance that was before the operator to the number. And the free function, notice its name does not start person::, it just compares the two parameters that it was given, in this case, the integer and the arbitrarynumber of the person. You see that I'm using this public function, GetNumber. That's because this operator< is a free function. It's not in the Person class. It can't access arbitrarynumber directly. arbitrarynumber is private, so I have to use this public GetNumber. Let's run this to show that it works. p1, which was 123, is less than p2, which was 456. Yep. p1 is less than 300; yes, 123 is less than 300, and 300 is not less than p1, also correct, so all of these operators work. It's a good sign. As a rule of thumb, if you're going to implement less than you should probably also implement greater than. You should consider implementing less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, is equal to, and so on. People will be very confused if they can only use one operator and not all the rest of them and it's quite common to implement these in terms of each other. I'm not going to show you all of that, just in the interest of time. I do want to consider the possibility, what would you do if there was no public GetNumber function in Person? This is a completely fake and arbitrary thing, so you know, we stuck a public function in it a long time ago for demo purposes, but it's quite common to write business objects that do not reveal their individual components. If there's a business need for it elsewhere within the application then you would add that public function, but there may not be a business need for it. Would you add a public GetNumber function for no other reason than to let this operator work, and if you didn't, what would be your alternative? Well, in C++, and many other languages don't give this capability, there is a way around this and the motivation for having a way around it has to do with this unfortunate circumstance that some of your operator overloads have to be free functions. They have to be free functions because you can't go into integer and add a method to it, but really, emotionally, spiritually if you will, this is part of Person. It's here in the same files as all the rest of the Person code. It's written by the same developer and yes, if I change this variable's name I'm going to have to rewrite all the Person code. I get that and you know what, I'll rewrite this at the same time, right. Given that I can make an exception to the public private rules for this particular function and copy this line, come up here and say friend, and then paste the line. This doesn't declare a function. I still have to declare it down here. What it does is it says, this is an exception to the rules about what is private and what is public. It doesn't make operator<, that takes an integer and a person somehow a member function of Person, but it does give it those privileges and once those privileges have been given to it, instead of calling this public function GetNumber, I can use this private arbitrarynumber, and I'll just build this to prove to you that it compiles (Typing) and indeed, it does. Without the friend statement (Typing) I get error messages, basically saying I can't access that private member, arbitrarynumber. The friend statement was what made the exception and that made it possible for that operator to access the private variable. You may have heard that the friend keyword in C++ breaks encapsulation and there's no denying it; it does. There I am letting a free function that is not part of Person access Person's private member variables, but it's not part of Person because of a quirk of the way the compiler has you write overloads. We've got the header for it here in Person's header. We've got the code for it here in Person.cpp and if someone comes along and changes the design of Person, they have a to-do-list of things they need to fix. They need to fix all of the methods that are already in Person and yeah, they need to fix this one too, and in case they don't happen to see it down here after the end of the class definition, they'll certainly see it here. This friend forms your to-do-list if you happen to change some of the private insides. The friend keyword has other uses that are less defendable than this one. This is 100% A-OK. It's less okay when you have two classes that share a lot of work and golly this is annoying writing these get things; I think I'll just make them a friend. That's generally a sign that you have misdesigned your pair of classes. Don't let what people tell you about that use of friend mess up this use of friend, which is entirely appropriate and a good practice. If you're writing an operator overload, the only way to write overloads where your type is not before the operator is to write free functions and in many cases, if you don't have public functions available to write those free functions with, you're going to use the friend statement to gain access to the private member variables. It's not wrong. Let's focus back, not on the complexity of the friend statement, but on the simplicity of this code. Because you take the time to write those overloads, which are admittedly a little funny, operator< is a weird function name, you get this super-readable code that uses your object. You put a little effort into writing your class and now the code that uses your class makes perfect sense, as much as it can make sense to ask whether one person is less than another, based on the value of an arbitrarynumber, but imagine you're doing something real, you know dates and purchase orders and things. Using the < here is more readable and more understandable than using a member function like compare or is less than all spelled out i-s-l-e-s-s-t-h-a-n. I love operator overloading. It puts a little effort on the author of a class, but produces very compact and readable code, which is a good thing.\n",

      "There is no denying it, C++ has a lot of operators. Arithmetic operators, including things you may not have heard of or that may not be in other languages you know, very specialized operators that were originally brought in for performance reasons and that remain because they are concise and they can express your intention without you having to write a lot. Now i = i + 1 or i++, when you're working with i it's kind of the same, but when you're working with long variable names, it's not the same at all. There are some traps waiting for some people. The double ampersand versus single ampersand, people accidentally using bitwise operators when they mean to use Boolean operators, people using Boolean operators and not realizing that they shortcut, and people mixing up the equality comparison operator, two equal signs, with the assignment operator, a single equal sign. A single equal sign is not going to trigger a warning or error message for you. It's often the right thing to do inside an if, but you need to be confident whether you really meant to do it or not. The suite of operators that C++ has lets you write incredibly concise, readable code and it lowers the burden on developers to remember how to do things or what things are called and that's especially true when you combine operator overloading. It's simply easier to remember the plus sign then whether something is called add or append or increment. It's easier to remember the less than operator than whether it's called compare and having less than return true or false is more memorable than having compare return -1 if it's less, 0 if they're the same, and +1 if they're greater. Using operator overloading puts a tiny more burden on the developer of a class and it really is a tiny more burden. After all, writing a function called ADD or writing a function called Operator+, not that different, and yet, the user of your class gets the ability to really think of your type, date or string or purchase order or employee, just as a thing, just like an integer or any other fundamental type. I think you've already seen that because string is a class; it's not a fundamental type. But I bet in your head it already feels like it's just a type, the same as integer, And date can be that way too and, if the author of the class puts the work in, so can employee or purchase order or insurance policy or whatever it is your application is all about. Once you get into templates you'll see even more how this fundamental similarity between say, an integer and a string, between a floating point number and a purchase order, enables you to write very interesting, generic code in a way that can't be done in other languages. For now, understanding the wide variety of operators that C++ offers and how you can be part of it by writing your own overloads of those operators, it's a good addition to your C++ knowledge.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language, C++. In this module you'll learn about templates. Templates in C++ are similar to generics in other languages, but different in some very important ways. When you first get started in C++ you can use templates right from the very beginning. In fact, sometimes you use them without even knowing it. It's less common to write them. I'm going to show you how to write them, but just so we have some simple templates we can use in the demos. Understanding how they work takes the magic factor out of using them and I want you to know what a powerful technique templates are in C++.\n",

      "Templates are the way that C++ implements genericity. Genericity meaning that you write a piece of code once and it can be used in a variety of contexts. There are generics in C# and in Java, as well as some other languages, different names for the same concept. However, templates are fundamentally different from just about everybody else's implementation. Templates are resolved at compile time, not at runtime. This has some benefits and some drawbacks. The number one benefit is speed. All of the performance hit is taken at compile time. There is zero performance hit at runtime. The compiler actually generates versions of the code for the various types that you're using it with. In languages that do runtime checks everything happens at runtime. There is a performance cost at runtime. This may give you a little more flexibility. It does, however, slow your application down. A generic-based solution can never be as fast as a template-based solution. The idea is that you write something, maybe it's a class, maybe it's a free function, and it can be used with a variety of different types. Imagine math work like finding the largest something -- could be the largest integer, could be the largest floating point, could be the largest bank account. Finding the average of a whole pile of things or keeping a collection, an ordinary array, a linked list, a queue, a hash table, a dictionary, every data structure probably that you learned as an undergraduate. You can have a linked list of integers or a linked list of floating points or a linked list of bank accounts or a linked list of employees and it doesn't really matter. The code about keeping track of the next node and the code for insert and the code for delete is identical regardless of what it is that you keep in there, but these are type safe collections, meaning that if I have a linked list of employees I can't add a bank account to that list. Type safety is a huge part of C++. This is how you achieve a type safe, high- performing collection, and algorithms that work across those collections, sorting them, searching them, that kind of thing. Operator overloads are big part of how many of these templates are actually implemented and that's what makes it easy to mix and match so that the same code can be used for say, integers and bank accounts. I find that other languages tend not to do that. Their general solutions often can only take user- defined types and not the fundamental types that often rely on the existence of member functions with names like add or compare that are not defined for fundamental types like integers. Using operator overloads gives you compact code and highly readable code. It is also what makes the same templates work for both fundamental types and user-defined types. We've mentioned the Standard Library a number of times throughout this material and I'm sure you're already convinced that it's full of rich goodness even though all we've really seen so far are strings and writing to the screen and reading from the keyboard. The old name of the Standard Library was the Standard Template Library, or STL, and old school C++ developers like me still often call it STL in casual chit chat. Yes, I have casual chit chat about compiler libraries; that's who I am. It's rich in templates, collections, algorithms, and a lot more besides, and as you move forward along your C++ path you're going to meet a lot of the things in the Standard Library and you'll understand them better if you understand templates.\n",

      "I thought I'd start by showing you a very simple template. It's right here. This is a free function and you can declare and define a function all at once as long as the whole thing is before you use it. I could have made a header called utility.h in which I declared this function and a cpp file in which I implemented it, but especially for templates we tend to do it all at once in the include and rather than have a separate file, which the include statement would have just plunked right here, I decided to simply put the contents here. You can see the structure of it. If it wasn't for this first line it would just look like declaring and defining a function. We have a function called max that returns something called T and it takes T references. If you're thinking wait, we covered all the types, int, float, da da da; what is T? T is a placeholder and it's traditional to use the letter T for this placeholder, but you're by no means obliged to. You could use whatever you like. This line here says, I'm defining a template and in my template there will be a placeholder for a class, and despite the word class you can also put fundamental types like ints and things in here, which I'm going to now refer to for the rest of the time as T. This says, whatever this is a template of, if it's a template of ints, I mean int. If it's a template of person objects, I mean person. That's what this function returns. Its name is max. It takes a T reference, which I'm going to call t1 and another T reference, which I'm going to call t2. We're using the immediate if and if t1 is less than t2 we'll return t2, otherwise, we'll return t1. So in other words, if it's a tie we'll return t1. If it's not a tie we'll return whoever's bigger, using the less than operator. It's hard to imagine a simpler function to write once you've really grasped _____ if you're done with the difficulty level of this function, but it's really pretty powerful. In fact, I should point out there's a better implementation of max in the Standard Library and we're only showing you max so that you have something to look at and to understand. I'm going to use it. Change my boundaries a little so you can see this whole line. I'm going to print out max of 33 and 44 is and then I'm going to call the function passing in 33 and 44, and the compiler's pretty smart. It says, hey, those are integers, you must want the version of max that works with integers and it'll use that one and return an integer that I can send to cout. Then I setup a couple of strings and I want to print out the max of them, and again, I just say max of s1, s2 and the compiler says well if you want to pass in a pair of strings you must mean the one that takes strings and returns a string. And I can even work with Person objects. Here I'm going to print out p1.GetName and p2.GetName just so I have something to put on the screen, but I'm actually determining the max of p1 and p2, and that returns a person. So on a person I can use the dot operator and call one of its member functions and that's how I can get somebody's name. I'm going to run this application and let you see the output. You can see that the max of 33 and 44 is 44. That fits what we know about numbers, that the max of hello and world is world. If you think about sorting, W coming after H in the alphabet, okay, that makes sense, and the max of Kate Gregory and someone else is someone else. Now in order to test if that's right or not you have to remember how we defined operator less than for Person. Come back and take a look in Person (Typing). Here's operator<. We compare their arbitrarynumbers. If one person is less than another, if their arbitrarynumber is less than the other, and the two arbitrary people I made here, Kate Gregory and someone else, someone else had a number of 456, so that's why they were the bigger. This is just kind of intuitive and easy to understand. You're just calling max -- max of two strings, max of two numbers, max of two person objects. There is a potential problem. I've got to include here BankAccount.h and I'll just open that up and show you this is a half-written BankAccount class. We're not going to design or write it. What you need to know about the BankAccount class in its current unfinished state, it doesn't have an operator<. Person has an operator<, which we discussed in operator overloading and you've just seen the code for. BankAccount does not. If I try to do this same behavior with BankAccounts as I've been doing with integers, strings, and persons I don't get the kind of delightful error messages that I would like to get. I have to tell you, when you're working with templates sometimes the error messages can be a little opaque. Here is some code that creates two bank accounts and tries to call the max of b1 and b2. Let's see what happens when I compile this. I'm just using the keystrokes to build it (Typing). If failed and the error is, no operator found which takes a left-hand type operand of type 'BankAccount.' That's not bad. It's even telling me that the problem is here with the less than, but you'd be tempted to go and say well I'm not calling less than. I don't understand what the problem is. You kind of need to know that max uses less than and that by calling max you're trying to use less than and you don't have one. You don't really get a good error message saying you don't implement the right stuff to use this template. The burden is all on you as the person who wants to use the template, in this case, a BankAccount developer who wants to use max needs to know what that imposes on BankAccount. By reading the documentation, if all else fails, maybe by reading the code and looking at it and saying, oh, I see it uses operator< or it uses operator+ or it uses a member function called compare or whatever it uses, and if for some reason you have neither documentation nor code, by getting error messages from the compiler. BankAccount's not eligible to work with max. It just is missing the operators that it needs to work with max and that's okay. You have to find another way to compare BankAccounts or you can write the operator that's missing for BankAccounts, but understanding that nobody's going to check for you explicitly. You'll get errors and eventually you'll figure out what causes the errors, but nobody's going to explicitly check whether a particular type is okay for use with a particular template or not. That's your job as the developer.\n",

      "Let me summarize what you just saw in that demo. First, when you want to write a template function you write it out with a placeholder standing in for all the different types that the function might be used with. Here's max for example. Starts template class T to indicate to everybody that this is a template and that T is a placeholder, and then you just use T as though it were a type throughout the function. In order to use it, generally the compiler will figure out what type you're using, so when you say max of 33 and 44 or of string 1 and string 2 or of person 1 and person 2, the compiler can work that out. There are times when it's ambiguous. Say, for example, you were to ask for the max of a floating point number and an integer. It could promote the integer to a floating point and use the floating point template, but it may not be able to figure that out on its own, and for other templates it's not possible. You could go either way. If you want you can specify which specialization you want, like this. This says, I'd like the max of 33 and 2.0 and I specifically want you to use the double version of max and that will of course, for the case of max, which returns a T, mean that it will return a double. They're really awfully simple to use and a person could use max without ever knowing it was a template. They could just believe that it had some magic ability to figure out the maximum of integers and strings and person objects just, maybe by understanding the meaning of the letters max standing for maximum. That's not how it is at all. It's a very simple template function. Now you know.\n",

      "Here's a template class. This is a very naive accumulator. It keeps a running total. It's not necessarily a paradigm of exactly how to write accumulators that keep running totals. There are things that will do this for you in the Standard Library, but I wanted to choose a class that you could easily see how it worked. This isn't a header file and there is not Accum.cpp. That's pretty normal that everything is in the header file, so that it can easily be brought in by the compiler everywhere that it's used. As with the functions, you notice we start template class T and then we are defining a class and this is the end of it as usual. Inside we use T for the type placeholder, just as in the function. Accum here, if you're making an Accum of ints it'll have an integer total. If you're making an Accum of floats it'll have a float total. It has a constructor that takes a starting value. It's probably going to be 0, but we're going to have a constructor that lets you pass in what your starting value will be and all it will do is, using C++ initialization syntax, initialize total to that starting value. Then, we have an operator +=. It returns a type and takes a type reference. I'll explain the const later. In the material on pointers we'll get into const. For now, when you take certain things by reference you have to say const, otherwise, you can't pass in a literal like three, which is a constant. Treat that as a little bit of a magic word for now. We'll come back to it. Operator+=, this is just ordinary common or garden operator overloading when you add t onto the total we should increment total, so total is equal to total + t, and we'll return that value. That may be of some value if people are chaining them or using them to pass down to other functions and that kind of thing. Then, I have a member function called GetTotal that provides access to the total and it is returning type t again, so if totals an int this returns an int, if totals a float this returns a float, and so on. And I have some code here that uses it. Now when you instantiate a template class you do explicitly specify the type, so here I'm saying I have an Accum of int and I've happened to give it a name integers, but you could of course call it hello or Tuesday or whatever works for you, and I'm passing in the starting value, which makes sense that we start at 0. And then I just use += a couple times and add more integers onto my accumulator, and then I ask for the total and print that out. Do the same thing with strings. I call it strings and this time I initialize it to \"\" rather than 0 -- that obviously makes more sense for strings -- and I'm going to put in hello and world. And the rest of the code in this main is commented out, so let's just run this and show what you get. So when we put 3 and 7 into the accumulation of integers, we ended up with 10. And when we put hello and space world into the accumulation of strings, we ended up with a hello world, so this works as advertised. That's nice. Good, simple, easy to use, and apart from the angle bracket syntax when you declared them, after that it's just perfectly ordinary class and you just use these intuitive operators and member functions. Now what do I have commented out down here? I have attempted to break the rules. I have mentioned a couple times that templates give you type safety. Integers is an accumulation of integers and its += operator takes an integer reference. When I try to use a string you can see I'm going to get red wigglies, says no operator += matches these operands. And similarly, strings is an accumulation of strings and when I try to add in an integer it says, no operator += matches these operands. I will build it to show you the compiler errors that you get in the output window. There's a lot more of them and they can be a little more intimidating. They do contain the same fundamental complaint that you saw in the tip, no operator found which takes a right hand operator of type ‘const char And just that, seeing T here and here, is your biggest clue that if it's an accumulation of integers you should add integers into it and if it's accumulation of strings you should add strings into it. This kind of type safety is a feature. This is what we want our templates to do for us, to let us write the code once and use it with a variety of types without forgetting what the types are, keeping all their true nature as an integer or a string or a person or a bank account, and getting the compiler, our friend the compiler, to tell us when we mess up. These lines don't compile because our accumulator is type safe and that's what we want.\n",

      "Here's the code you just saw in the demo. You start by writing the class out just using a placeholder instead of the type. We accumulate T, whatever T is, of an ordinary class definition with a private and a public section, member variables, operators, constructor, member functions, really nothing unusual, and when you use it you tell the compiler what type you'd like the template instantiated for, so I'd like to accumulate ints or I'd like to accumulate strings. The compiler will not check on this line and say, is it okay that you're using this type? Is int appropriate for the Accum class? It will check as you use or exercise members of Accum, so here you're going to exercise the constructor, and if there wasn't a constructor that was happy with having the number 0 passed to it for an Accum of ints, if there wasn't a constructor that's happy with having an empty string passed to it for an Accum of strings, you'd get a compiler error. If the appropriate constructor was there, but something else wasn't, that's when you'd find out that there were issues, so just as with the template functions, it can be a little challenging to understand your compiler errors, but in many cases the compiler errors are actually a feature. Once you've made an accumulation of ints you can't add strings to it and vice versa, and this type safety is a big part of what's good about templates.\n",

      "There's another thing that sets C++ templates apart from the way just about every other language does generics and that's specialization. The compiler will generate the code using the template for any type you pass it, but you can say, here's the code I want you to generate for this particular type. In other words, write the template once generically, here's how to find the max of any two things, and then again, specifically, here's how to find the max of two employees or two bank accounts. Why would you need to do that? Well, the thing is that sometimes templates don't work for certain classes. You saw that max relied on operator< and Accum relies on operator+. If you haven't overloaded the operator for those classes how could you use the template with those classes -- or if someone has overloaded the operator, but it doesn't do what you want the template to have that operator mean. When we are working with the simple classes that you see here it's really simple to decide what plus means. Want to add two people? I guess the only thing that makes sense would be to add their arbitrary numbers, but what does it mean to add two bank accounts or to compare two employees? The best thing to do is to add the missing operator. As you know, you can write any operator overload as a free function, so even if you're not the developer of BankAccount or Employee or Person you could add the missing operator as a free function. That's an excellent choice and may have other benefits in other parts of the application as well. It doesn't work if someone's already written it and there are other times when it's not an option either, so you do have a second choice, which is to specialize the template. This means you write a version of the template that doesn't have the placeholder in it and that says, here's how to specifically do the work I want to do for this incompatible class, for this Employee or BankAccount or Person object. Once upon a time the number one motivation for template specialization was C-style strings, strings very different from the ones we are using in this material, that were just awkward and horrible and always needed a special template done for them. It's a little harder to come up with a good reason for template specialization when our sample templates are so simple, but I want you to see the technique, so I'm going to show you how to do it. You will need to do it at some point because templates are just such a huge time-saver and proactivity boost for developers that when you find one that isn't quite right you need to know how to make it fit your situation.\n",

      "Let's try to accumulate people. There's no operator+ defined for people, so it's not going to work, but that's good. That gives us an opportunity to write a specialization. (Typing) Here's our accumulator class, as we saw at the end of the last demo, and you may have already noticed that Person is already in this project. I'm going to paste in some code because watching large quantities of typing is never entertaining (Typing) and this code works because there is an include of Person.h here also. You can see that I'm going to declare sort of a dummy person. The first name and last name are both quotes and the arbitrarynumber is 0. This can be our start. Now, whether we define adding people to mean tacking all their names together, so that Kate Gregory plus Someone Else is Kate Someone Gregory Else. Maybe these are our employees and arbitrarynumber is their salary and I want to figure out our total salary burden, so I'm going to add up everybody's arbitrarynumber. That's probably a better way of thinking about it. Either way, I've got this sort of dummy person and then I'm going to make an accumulation of persons, called people, and I'll use that dummy person as the start because the starting value needs to be of the type of whatever it is we're accumulating. Declare a couple people and stick them in, just exactly in the way that we declared accumulator and plus equaled them into the accumulator of strings, we'll += our Person objects into the accumulator of persons. And then people.GetTotal will give us a Person. We can use the dot syntax and call whatever member variable we want on it, like GetNumber. It makes sense, but when you go to build it, and I'm just using the key strokes here, (Typing) whew, error messages like you wouldn't believe. Now, there are an awful lot of them, but what they basically boil down to is the +. Scroll out this way. I couldn't figure out what to do in order to handle the += when I wanted to accumulate these Person objects. Interestingly, it's only going to complain on these two lines. If I comment out these lines and then build, the build succeeds. The compiler has no objection to me declaring an accumulator of Person objects. It has no objection to me trying to call the GetTotal member function of that accumulator and it knows that GetTotal will return a Person, so I can call GetNumber on that. All of this is great. The only part it didn't like was the +=. And the reason it didn't like the +=? Because Person, for all the operators and goodness that it has, does not have an operator+, does not have a way to add two Person objects together. Now I have three opportunities as a developer to try to solve this problem. One is I could say, ah you know what, I don't need an accumulation of Person objects to figure out their salary burden. I'll just make an accumulator of int and then I'll go through my people and instead of adding a person, p1, into my accumulator, I'll call p1.GetNumber and I'll put the resulting integer into my accumulator. It's okay. It might be repetitive, you might have to type .GetNumber a lot, and you're sort of pulling some of the business logic about a person out into this calling code, so you have to know to call GetNumber. You're also of course, giving up type safety. People can put any old integer into that accumulator and the compiler will let them whereas, when we have an accumulator of Persons we have that type safety that people can't put anything else in there. Imagine even a very generic loop, if it has to write different code for Persons by calling GetNumber, that's kind of awkward, so a generically-written loop would be tripped up by the fact that, oh, but for Persons we can't use the accumulator; we have to remember to call GetNumber, so let's rule out that possibility. The next choice is that I could write + for Person. I have Person.h right here in my project. I could totally go in and write the + operator for Person. I could write a free function for Person that constructs a new Person that's somehow bigger, based on the arbitrary number of the person I'm adding it to. It'd be a little bit of a challenge. There is no public set name function in Person, so I don't know how I'd set the name of the new person. I could use GetNumber and SetNumber; that's all fine, kind of awkward. What I want to show you and what is, in many cases, the only approach that will work is to write a template specialization for Accum that says here's how you handle the special case of Person. The first time you find a template not working for you, you may find a bit of a work-around, the equivalent of calling GetNumber and then, oh yeah it works great with ints. That's fine. You know how to call a member function. I don't need to spend any more time on that. The second time you find a template that doesn't work for you, maybe you just find a work-around by writing the operator as a free function or by going into the class and writing the operator. That's a good choice, especially if having that public operator anyway has other value in your program, but the day is going to come when you want to use a template, maybe even a template that you wrote. It doesn't work with your class; there's just no work-arounds; you can't write the operator because it's already written and you don't want to accept what it does; and you need to write a template specialization. It's not a hard thing to do at all, so let me show you. In fact, in the case of accumulator, we gain a real benefit by writing a specialization, which is that we can actually change the type of our running total while we're at it. Let's go into Accum.h and I'm just going to copy all of this (Typing) and put it here. When you write a specialization the brackets here become empty, but they don't go away. You still say, I am writing a template. That way the compiler, when it goes to do the template instantiation, looks at this one too. Here, I say this is the specialization for Person. This is how you write an Accum of Person objects. Now I have no more T placeholder, so I need to take it away. Most of the time you run through and just mechanically change T to the type you're writing a specialization for, which would be person in this case, but you know, it doesn't really make a lot of sense for the running total of my Person objects to be a person. The name doesn't mean anything, so I'm actually going to take an opportunity here and say, you know what, my running total is an integer, and I'm going to an integer for my starting value that I will initialize total to and my += will return an integer. Now it's going to take a person and it'll return total equals total, but I can't say + t because you can't add -- take an integer, and add a person to it, so here's where I'll call GetNumber. And notice the compiler understands that t is a person and gives me IntelliSense here, so I can call GetNumber and then my GetTotal will return an integer. All my red wigglies have gone away. I'm going to take this const out of here and I'm just going to have to ask you to trust me. I told you that it had to be there for when people passed constants like three. There isn't such a thing really as the equivalent of a literal person and, at the moment, it wouldn't compile if I left it in. When we get to the const material you will understand why and that's not very far away, so trust me. Let's go back to the Main now. We don't need this fake person for start purposes (Typing) and I can actually just pass in the starting value that I want of 0, make a couple of people, and now I can accumulate those people. Now people is of type integer rather than Person, so I --- do need to call GetTotal, but I don't need to call GetNumber on that, so I can just do this. See we have no wigglies, but I will build it just to confirm. Build succeeds. Now let's run it. 10 and hello world are from our old demo; they still work. And you notice it's also now printed out 579 and if I look at my two people, 123 + 456 is indeed 579, so we successfully accumulated these two people building up an integer running total and which we were able to print out. It really wasn't hard to write the specialization for person. When the day comes that you need to write a template specialization, you know how, and if you find yourself arguing about whether or not template specializations need to exist, you've seen an example of what they can be good for.\n",

      "Templates are really not that scary and they are one of the things that make C++ such a high performing language for you write applications in. They check what's going on at compile time. When you try to put an inappropriate type into a collection or add it to a running total the compiler complains, not at runtime, so you can't execute the code that has the problem that's violating type safety. And at runtime there's no need to check; it wouldn't have compiled if it wasn't a type safe behavior. That's why your application can be so fast when you use templates, but the productivity is really pretty dramatic. As long as your types are compatible with the templates you're using it can really package up, well, just about everything you'll learn as an undergraduate, but in some cases you barely even notice that you're using the template. If you happen to have a type that doesn't work with a template as written because you're missing an operator, because you're missing a member function, because your template is special in some way, then you can provide an operator, if that's appropriate, or write a template specialization and handle the special cases of your code that the person who wrote the template didn't know was coming. Now, despite the fact I wrote templates in my demos, you know you are not going to start by writing templates. You're going to start by using them. I let you see them being written so that you understand they're very simple and they're not that magical. The power is really in the language feature, not in the fact that someone went and wrote a 1,000-line template. That said, the templates in the Standard Library are more complicated than the super simple ones that I showed you. They work with special edge cases. They check for errors. They understand that sometimes additions might overflow or other unusual circumstances might arise. Using a template saves you a ton of development time. Whether it's for collections, whether it's for algorithms, whether it's for simple mathematical transformations, you shouldn't be writing that code. You're hardly the first person who ever came across the idea of, wow, we could have a hash table. Obviously, any code you don't have to write, but that you can count on working is a big benefit, so with templates you get that library power without taking a performance hit. They are probably the best thing about C++ when you compare it to other languages and now you know how they work.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language, C++. In this module it's time to finally tackle the most scary part of C++, pointers. Now you've seen you can write useful and powerful C++ applications without pointers. We've written a lot of code and covered a lot of ground in a completely pointer-free way. In fact, if you have pointers or difficult stories from other people or memories of your own, you know they're based on how C++ used to be written. That said, it is time to see what pointers are, what they're for, how you can have long-lived objects in your applications, and why it's not as bad as people have told you. This is also the place to discuss references and the const keyword, so let's get started.\n",

      "Let's start with what a pointer or, for that matter, a reference actually is. They are variables and a pointer is a variable that holds the address of another variable. You can then use the address to go kind of through the pointer to get to the original place that it was pointing to. You can change the pointer to point somewhere else or you can go through it and use it to change the value that it points at. One way to get one is to take the address of an existing variable, so if you had some integer A, you could take its address with the address of operator, which is spelled capital seven, and that would return a pointer to that integer. You met the punctuation ampersand before when we were declaring references. There is a deliberate similarity. The symbol is supposed to make you think of addresses and pointers and so on, but when the ampersand is before a variable it means, please take the address of this instance, this A. When the ampersand is at the end of a type it means this is an integer reference or an Employee reference or a BankAccount reference, so they're very different. Here, when we take the address of A, which is presumably an integer, we get an integer pointer, and you can spell integer pointer either int*, all one word, or int *. Actually you can have as many spaces as you want before and after the star, but these are the two most popular ways to do it. And I have to tell you the compiler doesn't care which of these you do, but a lot of humans do. The way you read the first one is you say, I'm declaring an integer pointer called pA and I'm initializing it with the address of that integer A. The way you read the second one is you say, an integer is the contents of pA and I'm initializing pA with the address of A. I prefer the first one, but as I often say when I discuss this with people, I'm married to someone who prefers the second one and we get on just fine. Don't get worked up about where the star goes. The fact is when you see a star with a type you're declaring a pointer. When you see an ampersand before an instance of a variable you're taking the address of a variable, which gets you a pointer, which you can put in some other pointer variable. Now once you have one the way you use it, as I alluded, is with the star operator, so *pA means take that pointer and go follow that value. So if there was a numerical value 123456 in pA it would go to memory location 123456 and that's where it would put, in the sample you see here on the slide, it would put the value 5. The pointer's still pointing to the same place, but we went through the pointer to get to its target. When the target is an object rather than an integer you can imagine that you could go through the pointer to get to the object at the other end and then say dot and use some member function of the object that's being pointed to and you can, in fact, do that. However, because of order of operations you have to put a bracket around it. So you could say, bracket star p bracket dot, and that would mean evaluate the pointer, go through the pointer to the memory that's there, and now dot, I want to call a member variable on that. That's kind of awkward, so you can also just use this arrow operator, and you get that by typing two characters, minus and the close angle bracket or greater than, and generally people pronounce it points to or arrow. I've heard a couple people pronounce it at, but I don't care for that because I tend to use that to pronounce the open bracket of some function calls. You'll see pointers being used with both fundamental types, like integers, and with objects in the demo. One important aspect about a pointer is that they're not always initialized to be pointing to something. They're not always initialized with a value that is somebody's address and it's up to you if you would like to give them the value that means \"not pointing to anything.\" We generally tend to refer to that as a nullptr, so if you just say integer pointer p it has a number in it, the same as all the way back in the first few demos I did with fundamental types. If we just said int i, you know there was a random number in it, whatever bits happened to be in that memory before, but it's not useful. It's not a pointer and you can't use it and it's very important if you're going to work with pointers that you get them assigned values when you first create them, even if that value is the hi I don't point to anything value. Now you have some choices about what value to use for hi I don't point to anything. You can actually get away with typing the number 0. The compiler will understand that that means something and you can use that to test the pointer and make sure that it does point to something because, as you remember, 0 is false and any other number is true. Better to use the all caps NULL. This isn't actually a language keyword it's just a macro, something that a lot of people define in their applications, and by a lot of people I mean everybody. I mean really, everybody defines null to 0 and sometimes people stay up and argue and say what if null was defined to three, then what ha ha. Null is defined to 0 and that's that, but you know what, who cares because now in C++ 11 we have a language keyword, nullptr, or nullptr as many C++ folks pronounce it, to kind of distinguish it from the ordinary English word null pointer. This keyword is perfect for saying this is a pointer that doesn't point to anything and you can test it and it will return false. A pointer that's got the value nullptr will return false when you say if the pointer. C++ got pointers from C, but it added its own capability references and references are, in a lot of important ways, much simpler than pointers. You can think of it as an alias. You can change a pointer to point to a different place. It can point to A for a while and then start pointing to B; references can't. They get their targets set when they're declared and that's that. Anything you do to a reference you're actually doing to the target and you don't have to use different punctuation like star or points to. You can just talk to it directly as though it were the original object and, for most people, that makes references a lot simpler. I will show you them both in action.\n",

      "Here's some sample code that just plays around with pointers and I have to tell you that this demo suffers from the same problem that all first pointer demos suffer from, which that it is utterly pointless and I'm just going to confess that to you. I'm going to show you the mechanics and the syntax of how to get pointers and how to use them, but you would never do this. You have a perfectly good integer A; you would just work with A. Why would you make a pointer to it and then go through the pointer? Where pointers become useful is when, for example, you pass them down to a function or you keep them in a member variable and then you use them again later. Then, knowing how to go through the pointer to get what you want back from the original fundamental type or the original object is a useful thing to know. That sets up a lot of complexity for our first demo, so we do it all together. Hopefully this is pretty straightforward. I make myself an integer called A, print out its value, make a pointer to that very same integer by using the address of operator, and then I use the pointer, *pA, to change the value that the pointer points to, to 4. Since the pointer points to A, this also changes A's value to 4. There's only one piece of memory. You can just talk to it two ways, you can call it A or you can call it *pA. And I make a different integer and now I change my pointer, pA, to actually point to b and of course its name means nothing right? So, it's called pA, but now it points to b. If I take the contents of pA and do a ++ operator on them, b will be incremented from 100 to 101. Here when we print out the contents of pA it's going to print out 101. It works with objects too, so here I make a Person called Kate and a Person pointer called pKate is equal to the address of that object Kate. And then this is kind of the long way, I can say the contents of pKate, wrap that in brackets and then dot SetNumber. And as you can see the compiler, I've got no error messages here. It knows that that is a Person function, but I can also use the arrow notation. So here where I'm using a solid object Kate, I use the dot notation. And here where I'm using the pointer pKate I use the arrow notation, pKate points to GetName. The same thing's going on over here with number. Then we have some references, integer reference rA. Now, unlike a pointer, you can't just say, oh I have this integer reference and I'll tell you later what it points to. You have to say, is equal to, in this case, a. Then if I change rA to 5 that will actually change a to 5 because rA is just an alias now for a. You saw this when variables were passed down to functions. The parameters were passed by reference, that when you changed the local variable inside the function it actually changed the value of the parameter back in the calling code that had been passed down by reference. That's what reference means, that you can kind of change another place, talking to it with this different name. You can have references to objects as well as to people, so here I make a Person reference to that same Kate object and call its SetNumber and then I can call its GetName and notice because it's a reference that I'm using dot notation both for the gets and for the sets, for all the member functions, which for many people is more readable than the pointer notation. Let's quickly run this just to prove that everything does what you think it will do. a is 3. Let's just line these up. a is 3. When we make the pointer pA and then change its contents to 4, a becomes 4. We make the pointer pA now actually point to b and then we increment it. When we print it out pA becomes 100 that then got incremented to 101, so it's not touching a anymore it's only now touching b because that's where the pointer points. With the objects we have a 234 from my arbitrarynumber and then using the pointer we change it to 235, print it out both ways. We get 235 both ways because they're again, the same piece of memory, no matter how you talk to them. When we set rA to be a and then change rA to 5 and then print out a, a is now 5 because rA is just an alias for a, and similarly when we make rKate to Kate and then set its number to 345, print it out, it prints out 345. I have code here that's commented out and let's kind of go through and talk about how the compiler would help me if I absent-mindedly wrote this code. Here, I declare a pointer, and it's sort of foreshadowing that it has the name badPointer, and I don't set it to the address of anything. I just say, la la la, it's an integer badPointer and then I try to use it. I try to go through badPointer and put 3 in there. Also, down here I try to go through badPointer and get the value to print it out. If I run this (Typing) a bad thing happens and, specifically, the variable badPointer is being used without being initialized, so we'll just put that to stop. I told you that when I read the code, but you also noticed that it sort of blows up when the application runs and that's a really bad plan. I can make this a little better if I initialize my badPointer to nullptr. It's a C++ 11 feature if you're not using Visual Studio 2010 you can't use nullptr, but Visual C++ 2010 Express understands this C++ 11 feature, so it's all set. Now, if I just make only this change and run it things don't really get much better. After all, it still doesn't point anywhere right? We do still unfortunately go boom, but you notice we're going boom in a nicer way? It's actually possible that we could send an error report, I'm not going to, and that this might be a less severe situation. In fact, here we throw a nullptr exception that I could handle. We haven't done exceptions yet, so I'm not going to dwell on that. What's really important about initializing your pointer to nullptr is that you can test for nullptr very compactly. So I can come here and say if badPointer (Typing), I'll use it, otherwise, I won't. If I run this code (Typing) we don't blowup. The if kept me out of this block and prevented me from trying to dereference, that's what this process is called, preventing me from trying to dereference the bad pointer. Now, you might think well, it was just the if that helped you out, so let's take the equals nullptr back away and run it again (Typing). We're back to the very bad thing. Setting it to nullptr is what enables me to test whether, in fact, it's a nullptr or not. When a pointer has the value nullptr or nullptr, as some people like to pronounce it, this if will return false and we'll be protected. When it has random bits that happened to be in that location before, it won't be protected. Any nonzero number comes out as true, so the if badPointer will say, oh yeah, we're good, and it will go in here and try to dereference the pointer and then your program will blow up. If you're going to use a pointer you need to be sure that it was initialized. One way to be sure is to declare them and immediately give them a value, as you saw right here, but another way is to declare them and immediately give them the value nullptr and then always check to see if they're nullptr or not before you use them. Let's uncomment some badReference code now (Typing). Pretty much the same thing, but an important difference. There's red wigglies right here. There wasn't here. (Typing) Compiler's fine with you just declaring pointers and not initializing them to anything. Let's put that back before I forget. It's not fine with you declaring a reference and not initializing it to anything, so you can't make this mistake and there's no way to test, is this a null reference because there's no such thing as a null reference. References have to be initialized pointing to something real and that's one of the ways that they are simpler because you can't, oh I have to initialize, I have to check if it's null yet. It's not optional. It will be initialized. It won't be null. You will be able to use it. That's also, sometimes, the reason why you can't use references because sometimes, you know, things are optional and you don't know if they're set or not. When you can use references I prefer to use them; they're simpler. You can use the dot notation instead of the arrow and you don't have to check to see if they're null or not, but that's exactly why you also sometimes can't use them.\n",

      "Const is a C++ keyword and as the keyword it's spelled with a lowercase c. It means that you promise you won't change a value. That might be because you simply want to impose a little rigor on yourself or it might be that you're being given a value that you're not allowed to change and you have to promise that you won't. You can declare a local variable like this, const int zero = 0, and any code that tries to set 0 to 10 or -3 will trigger a compiler error. It's not allowed to be changed. You can take a function, foo here can take a const int i. That's a semi-pointless thing to do, right, because i here is being passed by value and any changes you make you'll only be changing inside foo and who cares because they'll be thrown away when foo goes out of scope. But the second line, something takes a const Person reference p and we've said a couple times, when you pass something by reference someone can reach through the reference and change the value back in the call in code. Taking a const reference says, actually I won't. It means, I'm taking this by reference because the cost of a copy might be expensive. You know, when you take a function parameter by value, that integer or that person or that insurance policy or whatever, is copied into a temporary that's given to the function and that may be a very expensive copy. Passing by reference prevents the copy, but it enables someone to change the real object back in the call in code and if you don't want that then you write const person reference p. What will happen now is when the compiler compiles something, if any code in it changes p you'll get a compiler error, so it's a very safe way to say, I'm giving you a reference to spare the copy, but this doesn't mean that you can actually make changes back in my code. Imagine that I take that Person p as a const reference and I call some member function on it like GetName or GetNumber. Unless the compiler knows that those member functions don't change any of the member variables of person it won't allow you to make the function call. You have to give it that reassurance and you do that this way. This says that the GetName function won't change any of the member variables of the class. That makes them safe to call on a const reference. If we have a const Person or a const Person reference or whatever called p and we want to call p.GetName. That's safe to do as long as the compiler knows that GetName is a const function. It won't change any of the member variables of p. As you can imagine, getting all your consts lined up can be a challenge. It's called const correctness, so if our function something takes a const Person reference and the code for something calls p.GetName, GetName has to be const. Well GetName's really simple. You've met Person in lots of these demos. You know that all it does is return the first name and the last name tag together, but what if it called another member function? Well than that member function would have to have const on it and some of the functions may take parameters that need to be labeled as const whatever reference to make sure they're not getting changed. If you leave const correctness till the end of your development it can just drive you crazy, but if you do it as you're writing it can actually be a supportive framework that helps you to write higher quality code.\n",

      "Here I have an ordinary console application and I'm using the Person class once again, and I've also declared a little function here up above the main. Let's take a look at what the main does -- starts really simple. I make a local integer called i, then I make a constant integer called ci. They both happen to have the same value in them. I'm allowed to change the value of i, but if I try to change the value of ci I get wigglies. Error. Expression must be a modifiable lvalue. Const variables aren't modifiable, so modifying them gets you an error message. Let's take a look at this function DoubleIt. Right now it takes its parameter by value. Let's change it so that it takes it's parameter by reference. This causes an error here. Why? Because 10 is not modifiable. If I have code in here that I don't know, makes x 4, that's allowed and it would change what was passed to it, so here when we called it with j it would change j and in here it would try to change the 10, which is just weird. Now, there's no particular reason to take an integer by Reference. The cost of copying an integer is not important, but many people are in the habit of taking things by reference, just, it's a habit and they do it. When you take something by reference then you should try to take it by const reference. Now making that change makes this line happy, but now you notice it's made this line unhappy and this unhappiness here is, well, what are you doing? It must be modifiable, right? Because once you've said it's a const reference you can't change it. Let's take that away. Now we have, generally, a happy compiler. Any time you're going to write a function that takes something by reference and you might pass a literal, like 10, to it it needs to take it by a const reference, and that's what you saw in the template. We had const t ref. We take those things by reference because operators should take their parameters by reference for a variety of reasons and if you're going to pass literal constants like 33 and 44 then it has to be a const reference. Now I've got some code that's going to work with objects. I have a Person object called Kate, and I can call SetNumber on that, and then I have a const Person called cKate and I have some commented out code that's going to try to talk to it. Let's uncomment this one, (Typing) trying to call SetNumber, and see I get an error message, and it's not quite as good as the error message when you were trying to change the value of the constant int, but the object has type qualifiers that are not compatible with the member function. It's a constant; I'm trying to set its number; that's a bad thing. You know what, if I uncomment this line I also get an error here. Same thing: type qualifiers that are not compatible with the member function. We look at GetNumber and we're like, that doesn't change any member variables. Let's take a look at the definition of it. It just returns number. It doesn't change anything. How could this possibly be a problem? Well here's the deal. When the compiler has this line to process it doesn't go and look at all the code for GetNumber. In fact, it doesn't have access to all the code for GetNumber in some cases. Right?, that may be off in some cpp. For the particular case of Person the code is inline in the header file, but you can't count on that, and even if it was available, it's not a good use of the compiler's time to be rooting through your code to look and see if it changes any member variables. Instead, the way that you say this function doesn't change any member variables is you put the word const in your declaration. Now notice, if I put const here I have to build in order to get my header file parsed, but I get errors. (Typing) Specifically here, arbitrarynumber cannot be modified because it is being accessed through a const object. By saying its SetNumber was const now my code won't compile because you know what, SetNumber's not a const function of Person. It changes a member variable of person. Compiler won't let you lie here, so take that away. The compiler will let me say that GetNumber is const. Well, it will also let me say that GetName is const and when you have something declared in the cpp you need to put the const in both places here. Now GetName is const because I put it in both places. GetNumber's only in the header, so I only need to put it there. SetNumber isn't const. It changes member variables of Person. If you look down the rest of these operators you can probably also put some const correctness in here relatively simply. You know that the operator< doesn't change the Person that you're comparing to and doesn't change this person either. This is not by reference, so it's harmless, but we'll put that it doesn't change this. And the friend, the free function, can't have a const modifier out here because it's a free function. It doesn't have access to member variables of Person, but I can say that it takes a const ref. Then, for those that are implemented here in the cpp, while they don't match I'll get warnings saying, uh I don't know why you're telling me about the operator< that takes a Person reference. As far as I know you don't have one of those. It's true. I only have an operator< the text of const Person reference. I also need to add this here that it doesn't change it, any of the member variables of the class, and here. And this isn't a member function, so I wouldn't put the const out on the end there. I have red wigglies here. They tell me that I'm not allowed to access arbitrarynumber. It's a little confusing because, didn't we make it a friend? No, we made this one a friend. (Typing) Now that one's a friend. If you think, as you go to write the function, do I change the things I'm passed if I'm taking them by reference? Immediately put that const in there. You don't have to go through this process of fixing it up afterwards. Let's go back now. Notice we have red wigglies underneath call to SetNumber, but not to GetNumber, and that's really what you would expect. GetNumber doesn't change the person; it's a perfectly safe thing to call on a const Person. SetNumber does, and no amount of adding the word const is going to fix that. In fact, when we tried making SetNumber a const function it failed.\n",

      "You can use the const keyword when you're declaring pointers too and it has two different possible meanings. First, you can declare that the pointer is a constant pointer. This means it can't be changed to point somewhere else, so in the first pointer demo the pA pointer suddenly started pointing at B instead. A constant pointer can't. Or, you can say that it's pointing to something const. Then *cpI is const and you can't say *cpI = 7. You can't use the pointer to change the value of that const integer. As you can imagine, if you take the address of a const integer, you better put it in a const integer pointer saying I'm pointing to something const. Course, you could do both if you want. This syntax declares a pointer that you cannot change to point somewhere else and nor can you go through the pointer to change the value of what it's pointing at. I've called it crazy because it sounds like there'd be nothing for it, but you can use it to get values and to invoke const functions, which may be enough for you.\n",

      "I'll just quickly show you the error messages that you get when you declare constant pointers or pointers to constant things and then break your own rules. Here, I have some code that works with the const and non-const objects that we already have kicking around. This is an integer pointer pI that's the address of i, no problem, but if I uncomment this line, if I try to take the address of that const i, a value of type const integer pointer can't be in use to initialize an entity of type integer pointer. In other words, if I want to do that, get that address of cI, I have to put it in a const integer pointer. Here, I'm going to make a Person pointer, address of this Person up here. That's fine. And another local Person, and then I'm going to try to make some pointers. So if I make a const integer pointer, that is a pointer to a const int called pcI, I can point that to the same place that this pI is pointing. In other words, the same non-const I under the covers, but because I've said that it's a pointer to a const, if I then try to go through it and do things, expression must be a modifiable lvalue. The compiler doesn't try to follow back the chain and so on. I said pcI was a pointer to a const, then I tried to use it to change the value. What am I doing? And I get an error message. Notice, however, that I can change the pointer itself, pcI, to now point to a completely different local variable, j, that's sitting up here and is a non-const integer. Can take the address of that, put it in pcI, not a problem. I'm allowed to change where the pointer points to. Here the word const has moved away from the type and closer to the pointer. This is a constant pointer, so I can use it, *cpI, reach out through the contents and change where it points to the value 4, which means that i, among other things is going to change to 4. But this line of code that tries to get it to point to j instead: (Typing) expression must be a modifiable lvalue. I'm not allowed to change the value of cpI, not the value that it --- want to store through it when I go *cpI, but the actual value in cpI, the address, not allowed to change it. Now here's this crazy one, constant pointer to a constant int and I can't do either of these things, so I (Typing) can't reach out through the pointer, must be a modifiable lvalue, and can't try to get it to point somewhere else. (Typing) I can use it. I can say int k is equal to the contents of crazy (Typing), so it's not completely worthless I just can't change either where it's pointing to or the value contained in what it's pointing to and that's the story of const and pointers.\n",

      "So far, the only variables you've seen in all of these little sample applications have been local variables, what we sometimes call, being on the stack and having stack semantics. They go out of scope when the function ends and in fact, they go out of scope when they hit a brace bracket, so if you have an if and then you declare some integer i inside the brace brackets of the if, do some calculations, then you hit the close brace bracket of the if, the i actually goes out of scope. That's not always what you want. Sometimes you actually want variables that have a longer life than that and in C++ those variables live in what we call the free store. A small aside, many people use the word stack for local variables and heap for the free store and if you go to a computer science textbook and look them up stack and heap are data structures. They're ways of keeping information. With stack you push things on and pop them off and the heap is a way to keep a large quantity of data and be able to get to it when you want to. The technical terms, local variables or automatic storage, and the free store. I say heap a lot, meaning the free store, so do an awful lot of C++ developers. It's actually the leftover C name and many times the free store is implemented as a heap. It's not exactly wrong to use local and stack interchangeably, to use free store and heap interchangeably. It's a very common pattern among developers you're going to talk to. You may even meet a few guys who say, huh, free store? What's that? and you'll say, the heap and they'll say, oh, why didn't you say so. You may run into sticklers who say, what do you mean the heap? I believe you will find it's the free store. You're like, okay, so I'm telling you both names and technically the accurate name is the free store. That said, most developers say heap. Anyway, it's for longer-lived variables and there's an operator called new that sets aside some memory for you in the free store and this operator returns a pointer to what has just been created for you up in the free store, the instance of a class, the object. It also calls the constructor for you, so it creates the object completely: sets aside the memory, sets aside the memory, runs its constructor. What you get back is a pointer to a fully-constructed, happy, ready-to-go object. It will stay on the free store forever until you decide you don't want it anymore and then you call delete on that pointer that you got back from new and, among other things, the destructor will run to clean up anything that the object has a hold of and the memory will be released back to the free store to be used for other requests to new up an object. If you were creating what we call a raw array, if you want 100 integers you want the memory for 100 integers continuously on the free store, the syntax is a little different for both the new and the delete. However, beginners should stay away from raw arrays and instead use collections from the Standard Library that we'll get to later. Using new and using delete are how you manage the lifetime of the objects that you create up on the free store.\n",

      "Let's elaborate on this. You create something up on the free store with new and you get given a pointer. Somebody has to call delete on that pointer to give that memory back to the free store. In its simplest form you have beginning of a function new employee, do something with employee pointer, at the end of the function, delete the employee pointer, but that's kind of pointless. You could've just used a local variable. Why did you bother newing something up? Probably this pointer is going to go into a member variable of a class and you need to keep track and call delete when everybody's done, but along the way some strange things can happen like, someone could copy your pointer and maybe they still have the copy when you think you're done with the original pointer. If you delete the pointer, the copy they have is pointing to memory that's not available for use. That's a blow-up-your-application situation or if you keep your pointer in some local variable that goes out of scope and you don't have the pointer anymore to call delete with. Manual memory management is flat-out hard. You can delete things too soon and then other code tries to use them and they're not there. You can delete twice and you can never delete, which is a memory leak. It's actually quite difficult. The good news is you almost never have to do it. Library writers have solved this problem for you, but to convince you that you want to use what the library writers have written I'm going to show you how to do it yourself by hand so that you know what you're being saved and so that you maybe understand where some of the eye rolling and stories have come from, from people who say, oh my gosh, C++ pointers, new, delete, memory leaks. You have to do it yourself by hand. I'll show you what they're talking about, but the whole time I'm doing it I want you to remember you probably don't have to do this. Okay? I'm going to teach you something called the Rule of Three. The Rule of Three says, if you write a destructor that really does something bad, because remember delete doesn't just give the memory back it also runs the destructor, you should also write a Copy Constructor and a Copy Assignment Operator. I have a demo for you in which we're going to deliberately trigger all kinds of chaos and mayhem and slowly bring it under control by writing the big three: Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, and Destructor.\n",

      "I'm going to start by showing you manual memory management when there aren't member variables, when you're just working with local storage that has pointers to something on the free store, and those pointers can go out of scope when your local function ends. That will be the start of our complications. Here I'm using a class called Resource. It's very simple. It just has a string in it. It has a constructor that takes a string and I'll show you the code in a second, but it sticks it in this variable, not surprisingly, and a destructor, and it has a GetName that gives you that string back. The constructor does initialize the string, as I mentioned, and it also prints something out, and the destructor prints something out, so we can do some lifecycle tracking. First, I'm going to create a Resource locally on the stack, as it were, and I'll call its GetName using the dot notation and then when we hit this brace it'll go out of scope and you'll see it go out of scope and the destructor run. Just a reminder of how local variables go out of scope when they hit their close brace. Then, I'm going to create a Resource on the free store using operator new. That gives me back a Resource pointer, which I'm putting in as variable pResource, and I'm going to use the arrow notation to call this member function GetName on pResource. Then, I'm going to start doing bad things. The first bad thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make a copy of pResource, put it in this other Resource pointer called p2, and I'll call GetName on that to prove it's still working and then I'll use delete to delete pResource. The first thing I'm going to do is try to use a pointer that I just called delete on, let you see what happens. Then, I'm going to set that to nullptr and delete it again, and then I'm going to try calling p2, and p2 is pointed to some memory on which delete has already been run. This is quite a collection of badness. What's going to happen is I'm going to run it; it's going to blow up; we'll look at the error; I'll comment out the bad line; we'll go like one line further and get the error again, and so on, so let's begin. Free store has stopped working. How far did we get before we stop working? Well, you notice we constructed the local and then destructed it, and we constructed the created with new and then we destructed it. In other words, we got past here. It was no problem trying to get these values from p2 or pResource into these local strings. We deleted this pResource. That caused the destructor to print out that it had cleaned it up, and then when we tried to do this it blew up, and I can prove that quickly with the debugger. I'll put the break point right here and just run to the break point. Okay, we're fine to here. There's some very small output there and when I step over this is where we blow up. When you do this under the debugger the error messages are a little different. You get unhandled exception, bad_alloc. It can be a little harder to read, so I've been trying not to get it to blow up under the debugger, but that's where we were when it blew up. I'm going to stop debugging and close the random piece of the Standard Library that we ended up in. We blew up because of this line, of trying to call GetName on pResource when pResource has been deleted. Let's do that and I'll run it again. (Typing) Oh, this is quite bad, right? We got into a destructor, obviously. It's printing out, destructing, but when it tried to get a hold of the name that's when it blew up. I happen to know which of these two deletes caused the problem and again, I can show you which by using the debugger. (Typing) Okay, we're fine till here. We set pResource to a nullptr. We try to delete a nullptr; that's harmless. You can do that all you want. Delete basically says, is it already nullptr, okay never mind and returns. Nothing bad happens, but when we go to delete p2 that's when the bad thing happens and it's simply that p2 is pointing to memory that's already been cleaned up and calling delete on it again, it is bad. Now just to prove that it's not the copy that's the problem, I'm going to comment out this line that sets pResource to nullptr. And now if I run, let's move the breakpoint, (Typing) this lines going to make it go boom, and it does. Deleting something that's already been deleted is a bad and dangerous thing to do. If you set it to nullptr it's safe. Here, p2 points to the same place that pResource points to and so, once you've deleted pResource, trying to delete p2 is exactly the same as trying to delete pResource twice. You might think that you would never make these mistakes, trying to talk to an object after you've already deleted it, deleting it twice, those sorts of things. Alright, I'll believe that. Let's comment out all this weirdness (Typing) and just run this to prove that we are currently a balanced application. (Typing) We construct the local one on the stack and then destruct it when it goes out of scope. We construct the free store one by calling new and it gets deleted exactly once; nobody blows up; everybody's happy. Huh. Who said this memory management stuff was tough? I don't know what you're talking about. Well I tell you what, let's just do something relatively mild here. I'm going to make myself an integer and I'm going to make a test to see if that integers 3, and you can tell that it is, and I'm going to return from my function early if it's 3. It could happen. Here's what's going to happen. We will call new and then we will return and we will never delete it. If I run this (Typing) there's no error; there's no blowing up, but do you see what happened? We constructed and destructed local, but we only constructed the created with new. We never destructed it. That's a memory leak. Now this application is about to end, so you know, what harm did the memory leak do? But in a real application if this wasn't my main, but a function that processed something, and if Resource was 1,000 bytes, 10,000 bytes, could easily be, and I leak that many bytes out of the free store, sooner or later when another part of my code tries to get memory from the free store it's going to be told, there isn't any, and that's when the application hangs, and well, back in the day we used to have to reboot the whole machine, but you're still at least going to have to end task your application. Memory leaks can be really crippling and memory leaks happen when you don't delete something. We have code to delete it, but that code doesn't execute because we bailed out in the middle of the function and occasionally, in this material, I refer to exceptions. You may say I'm never going to write return in the middle of a function. Exceptions can do that to you, so you have to think about how can you write your code in such a way that it works even if someone bails out in the middle of a function? Now here, my pointers, pResource, p2, they're local variables, not going anywhere. They don't have a long life themselves, although they point to long-lived things out on the free store. Things get a little weirder when you put a pointer as a member variable of a class. Here, I'm working with the Person class again, but this Person is a little bit changed from the Person that's been kicking around for so long and I want to show you how it looks. Person, in addition to a first name, a last name, and an arbitrarynumber now has a Resource pointer. When I construct a Person I set their Resource pointer to nullptr. Now this particular idiom is one that you would use if something is optional. You might have a Resource or you might not. When you don't have a Resource the pointer is nullptr. When you do have a Resource the pointer points to the one Resource that you have. We have a member variable in Person called AddResource and this member function creates a new Resource and puts that resulting pointer into this member variable, pResource. Here, I make myself a local Person. I'm going to call AddResource and then I guess my work is done. Let's see what happens. Constructing Resource for Kate Gregory and we're done, so this is a memory leak. We never destructed it. That was foolish. Now there's nothing wrong with allocating my Resource out on the free store with new. In fact, it's the only way that I can get a Resource that lives longer than this function. If I just created some local variable (Typing) and then said the pResource (Typing) is equal to the address of r, the minute we come out of scope here, (Typing) r goes out of scope. It's cleaned up, and pResource is now pointing to something that's been cleaned up and you saw how badly that worked out in the other demo where trying to talk to something that's already been cleaned up causes crashing. You can't do this. You want a Resource that lives out on the free store so that it lives longer than AddResource function runs. So the solution to the memory leak is there needs to be a delete somewhere, so we can go into the destructor for Person and say, (Typing) cleanup that pResource pointer. That's all. I don't need to check to see if it's okay to delete it or not because it started out as nullptr, and as I mentioned, you can call delete on nullptr and it's harmless. So I'll just call delete on it because nullptr nothing will happen, but if it was set with AddResource it'll call delete on it. Let's run this. One constructing, one destructing. We're back in balance. Hooray. That works, but only because the person who wrote the main hasn't done anything bad yet. What I want to do is to write a Person class that is thoroughly robust to people doing, well bad's not the right word, ordinary stuff that happens to be dangerous, running with scissors as it were. Here's one thing a person might do, they might call AddResource twice. Probably not on consecutive lines like this, but if it's a big, complicated application with lots of code passed through it, and it happens to come across the AddResource call more than once, what is my app going to do about that? And here, to make it easier to tell them apart, let's call SetName, (Typing) so that the Resources, they build their name from the name of the Person and we'll be able to tell them apart. I'll run these, and we're back to having a memory leak. We constructed the first one for Kate, then we constructed a second one for Kate2, and we ended up only cleaning up the one for Kate2. The one for Kate is just sitting out there still on the free store forever, causing a memory leak. Why? Because we gave this the name AddResource and that's what it does. It just adds another Resource out on the free store for us. It should probably have a different name. I'm going to leave its name alone, but I'm going to fix its code. If there is an existing pResource already, we need to get rid of it; clean it up. I'm just going to copy this line from the destructor. (Typing) Again, if pResource is nullptr this is harmless, but if there is a pResource this'll clean it up and then we'll new up a fresh one. Let's test it. Much better. We're back in balance. We construct the Kate, clean it up, construct the Kate2, and, eventually, clean that up when the Person object goes out of scope and its destructor cleans up its Resource. Okay, we're starting to create a person class that is managing this Resource appropriately, but again, we need to be robust to the sorts of things that people might do when they're consuming our Person class, so here's another behavior that maybe you didn't count on. I am making a copy of Kate and putting it in another Person object called Kate2. The compiler will actually construct a Kate2 object and copy each member variable over from Kate to Kate2. That's the default behavior. The first name will get copied over, the last name, the arbitrarynumber, and the pResource pointer, and then you know what's going to happen? When we hit this close brace right here this Person object's going to go out of scope and this Person object is going to go out of scope. The first one who goes out of scope will delete pResource. That's great. Clean up the free store; life is good. Then, the other one will go out of scope and will also attempt to clean up the very same thing. It's just like over here in this example where we deleted pResource and then we deleted the copy of it, p2. Here, on code you don't see, when Kate and Kate2 go out of scope they will each try to delete their own copy of that pointer. The second one, well, it's not going to be good. There we go. We're tucking along nicely, but we have that extra destructing and it's blown up -- exactly the same problem. We're trying to delete something twice. What can we do to protect ourself against somebody doing this? You could say, no copying people. The Person class is not for copying and there's even a way that you can get the compiler to help you with that, but I'm going to guess that that's probably not a rule you want to impose. After all, it would make it impossible to pass it to a function by value, for example. We have to teach the system how to copy Person objects safely and we do that by writing what's called a copy constructor. I'm going to go into Person and here, with the existing constructor that we already have, I'm going to add another constructor. (Typing) You know it's a constructor. It doesn't have a return type and it takes a const Person reference p. Now I need to implement my copy constructor. (Typing) I'm going to copy this one, but my parameters is not all these individual bits and pieces, (Typing) so const Person reference p. (Typing) And I'm going to initialize using the member variables of p. (Typing) Finally, for pResource, I don't want to copy over p's pResource. I could, but that's the problem that got us here, right? This is what the compiler generated for me automatically. I need to do something better. In fact, what I need to do is make my own Resource up on the free store and have a different pointer that points to that different resource on the free store. Now that different Resource can have the same values in it, so what I'm going to initialize this to is a new Resource, and remember it takes a string. I'm going to get the string by calling old p's pResource's GetName. (Typing) This copy constructor will just bitwise copy over the other three member variables; they're harmless, they're just strings of numbers. And for pResource I'm going to ask the old pResource for its name and pass that in when constructing a brand new pResource of my own. Okay. Let's give it a whirl. You can see that we are paired up nice and neat -- constructing, destructing, two constructing's, two destructing's. Everything's in balance. There's no leak. We're not blowing up, so we got through this person choosing to construct a fresh Person object from the Person object we already had. That's not the only kind of copying that happens. There's also, what's called the Copy Assignment, so if I take my existing, fully-constructed Kate, which has a Resource, and assign it to Kate2, which is also fully-constructed and has a Resource, the copy constructor is not what makes this happen. What makes this happen is the assignment operator. That's an overloaded operator just like operator< or operator > or operator += and the other operators we've talked about, and that, by default _____ a bitwise copy, and I guess you know what that means. It'll copy the pointer over and when they go out of scope they'll both have the same pointer and we'll well go boom. Just like that. In order to protect against this behavior we have to write an overload of assignment operator. I'll put that down here with the other operators and the signature, rather like the signature of the copy constructor, it's not yours to choose. This is the signature of an assignment operator. It returns a Person reference, that's so you can write x = y = zed, and its name is operator= and it takes a const Person reference p. Now let's implement it. (Typing) I need to get the pieces over and this is a handy way to do it. (Typing) I can't use the initializer syntax in an operator overload the way I can in a constructor, but I can just reduce my typing this way. (Typing) Here I'm copying the three member variables over, p.firstname, p.lastname, p.arbitrarynumber being copied into the appropriate member variables here, and I can new up a pResource, but there's something I have to do first. In the case where we were using the copy constructor, here, Kate2 was not already constructed and obviously didn't have a pResource. But here, where we're going in the other direction, Kate has a pResource that's pointing to something on the free store and if I wipe that value of pResource out, putting in the pointer I get from this second called a new, I'm never going to free the old stuff. So before, I new up something to put into pResource I've got to delete what is already in There. And again, remember if it was a nullptr that's fine; that's harmless. Almost forgot, we have to return something and the equals operator always returns *this. We've come all this way and never talked about this yet. This is a pointer that all member functions have secretly available, but because we haven't been living a very pointery life we haven't used it yet, that represents the object itself. When this line of code runs Kate = Kate2, this will point to Kate. When Kate.SetFirstName runs this will point to Kate and when Kate.AddResource runs it will point to Kate. If somebody called Kate2.SetName, this would point to Kate2 during that execution of SetName. It's, in fact, the mechanism by which member functions can get to the right member variable. This is a pointer. We don't return a pointer; we return a reference, so we dereference it with star. Star this, that's what usually return from an operator equals. Now let's run it. (Typing) We have four pairs and they match up. We construct and destruct here. Then we have two constructs, one destruct, so a net of one, another construct, so for a net of two, and then two destructs. No leaks. No booms. We have finally constructed a fully robust Person class. Because Person had a meaningful destructor, we had to write a meaningful copy constructor, and a meaningful operator= or assignment operator, two names for the same thing, and I will not deny to you, this is totally work.\n",

      "Are you thinking, there must be a better way? You're darn right there must be a better way. Listen, if you're a library writer maybe you would deal with this, but in your regular, everyday life just writing a Person class there is such a nicer way to do it. You see, C++, especially C++ 11, has what are known as smart pointers. Smart pointers are objects that you allocate in local storage, on the stack, as a member variable, whatever. They're solid objects. They're not pointers, despite their names. They have a pointer inside them. When the smart pointer goes out of scope you know what his destructor does? He calls delete for you. It's such a simple thing. It's actually templated. It'll work with any kind of pointers. A T pointer, so you can give it an integer pointer or a Person pointer or a Resource pointer, Employee pointer, whatever, and when you construct it it keeps a copy of that pointer. When it goes out of scope the destructor does delete on that pointer. No memory leak and it can't happen twice. It can't happen two few times, too many times. You're safe. What about the copying and the assigning? Well, there are different kinds of smart pointers. Some of them prevent copying, so you simply can't copy a unique pointer. Others keep track of how many people are using the pointer with a reference count. Not adding a reference count to Person or Employee, but inside the smart pointer there's a reference count, and so the destructor just decrements the reference count and when it gets to 0, deletes it. The constructor, obviously, increments the reference count and so does the copy constructor and so does the assignment operator, and most important of all, operator overloads for a pair of operators you probably didn't think of were operators, even though I say operator every time I talk about them, star and points to. The effect of doing this is that you can treat that smart pointer exactly like a pointer except you don't have to remember to delete it. It's not garbage collection. It's deterministic destruction. It will get deleted exactly when it goes out of scope or when the last person using the shared_ptr goes out of scope, but it feels like garbage collection because you're not writing all that code, and it saves you from having the destructor, the copy constructor, and the assignment operator, the big three, in your class that have a pointer in it. Oh, they're in the smart pointer, but you don't have to write the smart pointer; they come with C++ 11. You just get to use them. Watch what happens to our code when we do that.\n",

      "I love ripping out code. I think every developer loves ripping out code. (Typing) Less code to test, less code to worry about. I'm going to go into Person and change this Resource pointer (Typing) to a shared_ptr (Typing) to a Resource. Now, that's not going to compile as is, obviously. I've got to put include in here of memory and I need to call it by its full name, (Typing) std::shared_ptr. Let's talk for a minute about why I chose shared_ptr. It implements a reference counted sharing, so that when you copy or assign a Person around, the new Person is pointing to the same Resource as the old Person. I don't know, let's say it was the char and you changed some aspect of the char. Everybody, all the Person objects that were copied from each other, they would all now still be pointing to the same changed Resource. The old semantics that we implemented by hand were that each Person had their own individual copy of the Resource. I don't think there was necessarily a business reason for it; it was just, how else were you going to do it? We weren't about to implement reference counting inside person. In many cases, a reference counted shared_ptr is a really good way to deal with copying. If people are making copies of a policy or an employee record or whatever, it should still be referring to the same other things that it needs to refer to, and as long as one of those copies is still in scope we shouldn't be deleting the stuff out on the free store. So I'm going to use a shared_ptr to Resource here inside Person. Here's the fun part. I don't need the copy constructor anymore. (Typing) A copy that copies the shared_ptr to Resource in one Person into the shared_ptr to Resource in another is just fine. The reference count will get incremented. The sharing will happen. I do not need to write this code, so I can get rid of my copy constructor. (Typing) Similarly, I can get rid of my operator=. (Typing) When the assignment happens and it just lands on the old pResource, that's fine. It will do the right thing, send things out of scope if they need to go out of scope, (Typing) so I can get rid of my operator=. Here, where I'm initializing it's a nullptr -- remember how strings just initialize themselves to \"\" and you don't need to remember to do it? Shared_ptr's initialize themselves to empty, so I don't need to initialize pResource, another thing not to worry about, and I sure as heck don't need to delete it in the destructor. When Person's destructor goes off all of its member variables will be cleaned away, the strings, arbitrarynumber, all of them, including the shared_ptr, and the shared_ptr's destructor will go off and the shared_ptr's destructor, assuming that this is the last person who cares about this particular Resource, will delete the memory out on the free store. I don't even need to have a destructor. (Typing) I told you. Love ripping out code. (Typing) Now in AddResource I do need to worry about the old one. If there was one already I need to tell it, the shared_ptr, to let go of that Resource, and I do that instead of using delete like this. The error message, by the way, is -- you can't delete that; it's not a pointer, and it's true. Despite the fact its name starts with p, it's a solid object whose type is what we call a smart pointer, and it has a member function called reset. (Typing) Resetting a shared_ptr has it let go of its hold on something out on the free store. It decrements the reference count and if that takes the reference count to 0, it will delete it -- all done behind the scenes for you, not your problem. Now, you can't initialize a shared_ptr by just passing it something that you got from new, like this with the equals sign. The best way to get a value into this shared_ptr is to use the make_shared. It's again a C++ 11, all of this is C++ 11. Visual C++ 2010 supports the C++ 11 language changes. So here I'm going to use the make_shared function. It's a templated function and I need to tell it, I need you to make me a Resource, and then I just pass along the arguments to be given to the constructor and make_shared will take those arguments, give them to constructor for Resource, get itself a pointer, put in the member variable, do all the right things, and this smart pointer will be smart. I've made Person a lot simpler. I ripped out all that code that just took me so long to put in and that was knowing what I'm doing, but what is going to happen when I run this diabolical main that's running around copying things and calling AddResource twice, and so on? Let's find out. (Typing) It's all good. I have two constructs, two destructs, and I'm not making endless copies of the same Resource for each individual copy of the person. There's a lot of Persons being constructed that you're not seeing and they're all sharing the same Resource and only when the last one goes out of scope then the Resource is destructed. No memory leak, no blowing up, no rule of three because you don't have a raw pointer in Person anymore, you have a smart pointer in Person and, as you can see, smart developers use smart pointers.\n",

      "I showed you in the demo how switching a raw pointer to a shared_ptr from the Standard Library just makes all that work of the big three evaporate and this is how it should be. There are three important smart pointers in C++ 11. Shared_ptr, which, as I've mentioned, is a reference counted, non-intrusive, smart pointer, behaves well in collections, does everything you think it should do, really doesn't have flaws. Weak_ptr, which sort of works with shared_ptr. Every time you create a copy of a shared_ptr you bump the reference count. Sometimes you want to have a weak_ptr, which doesn't bump the reference count; its existence doesn't keep the object alive; and it's possible that the weak_ptr may become empty if the object goes away while the weak_ptr's still pointing to it, and it handles that really nicely. There's also unique_ptr, which can't be copied, and there's an algorithm available in the Standard Library called move that you can use to move values in and out of unique-ptrs. I should also probably mention auto_ptr, a previous attempt at a smart pointer that was in the Standard Library. Auto_ptr wasn't as smart as it should be and it worked really poorly in containers, so if you made a vector or some other standard collection of employee objects, solid objects, that'd work great or you could make one of raw employee pointers and it would work, but you'd have to delete all of the individual employees when you deleted the collection. If you put smart pointer auto_ptr into that collection extraordinarily bad things happened. Shared_ptr and unique_ptr don't have that problem; they work well in containers; auto_ptr does not. You should be using Visual Studio 2010 or Visual C++ 2010 Express. They have shared_ptr and unique_ptr. You, therefore, have no need in your life for auto_ptr. In fact, if you find an auto_ptr in old code that you're maintaining, you should give serious thought to replacing it because it's flawed in some important ways. Don't use auto_ptr when you're writing new code. Use shared_ptr or unique_ptr; they're the way to go from here forward.\n",

      "I showed you how much simpler using a shared_ptr is, but perhaps you need to be convinced that it's actually usable as a pointer. Back in the copy constructor and the assignment operator we had some calls to Resource's GetName function, which you see here, and if you remember what those calls look like it was just pResource, arrow, GetName. Let's come up with an excuse to call that from some other member function, a Person, having now deleted most of the member functions of Person that were managing Resource, so that you can see how easy it is still to use the pointer. Let's come here into Person and add a function called GetResourceName. The ResourceName's of strings, a GetResourceName, (Typing) doesn't take any parameters, doesn't change the object, (Typing) and it'll just return (Typing) that pResource, (Typing) points to, and you see I even get IntelliSense. pResource is the shared_ptr. It's not any kind of a pointer with a star and yet, because of the overload the operator points to, I can call the methods just as though it was a traditional raw pointer, so I can call pResource, GetName. (Typing) And now I've implemented GetResourceName. Back in here, if I want to I can take any one of these Persons and just declare another string. (Typing) They could be on one line, but let's do it down here. String s1 is equal to, say (Typing) Kate.GetResourceName (Typing) and we've implemented that function so that's going to work just fine and we'll be able to bring the Resource by calling GetResourceName, which is going to use the smart pointer pResource just as though it was a traditional raw pointer. One of the great things about this is that you can take code that was written using raw pointers, which is full of these arrow operators and so on, and just go and make this change, so that you declare to be a shared_ptr instead of a raw pointer, and then here use make_shared instead of =new and that, in very many cases, that, and ripping out all the deletes, is all that you have to do to switch over to a shared_ptr. Once you've made the switch you can forget that it's a shared_ptr and just treat it as though it was a raw pointer everywhere in your application. Dereferencing it with star where that's appropriate and by using this points to operator. Simple as that.\n",

      "Some people are scared of pointers. There's really no need to be. Being scared of memory management maybe, but not of pointers. Pointers and references are just another way to talk to the variables that you already have in your code and if you want to use certain constructs within your code, passing by reference, passing by address, keeping a pointer to something in something else, you've got to learn to work the syntax -- where does the star go; when do you use the arrow; what does the ampersand mean -- in order to work with pointers and references, but it's quite doable. Same with const. Const keeps your programs correct. It keeps you from accidentally changing things when you didn't mean to. You have some function called GetName; it shouldn't change somebody's number, and the compiler will help you through that. It's especially important if you're writing any kind of a function that takes a parameter by reference, but that might be given a literal like three, and it tends to spread through your code. Once you decide that this operator takes a const reference then you discover that, oh, gee that means GetNumber has to be const and GetName has to be const and this other thing has to be const. It's a much better habit to build const correctness in right from the very beginning. The minute you find yourself taking a reference say, why am I doing that? Am I doing that because I want to change it or am I just doing it for speed, so that I can avoid the copy? If it's just for speed immediately say, const whatever reference. Even if it doesn't matter to the compiler it matters to other humans who read your code. Now they know why you're taking it by reference; it's just for speed. And there are a number of member functions that you can write in objects that have a standard canonical form. The copy constructor has to take a const reference to whatever this type is. The assignment operator, the same. The addition and arithmetic and comparison operators have a standard form that involves typically taking a const something reference, and in often returning references as well. You need to understand references and you need to understand const in order to do a good job of writing operator overloads so that someone else doesn't come along and look at your operator overload and go, what? What? That's not what you return from that. Make it right. A real program, a program that doesn't just count to 10 or print someone's name out over and over again, or the kinds of demos we've been writing, real programs involve long-lived objects. When the program starts running somebody creates an object and many other parts of the application interact with that object throughout a long and healthy life, and that long and healthy life is almost certainly spent on the free store, which some developers call the heap. In order to allocate memory on the free store you have to call new. That gives you a pointer and then you have to live with pointers. You can't live a pointer-free life because you're going to need to get stuff living on the free store and that means you're going to have to be comfortable working with pointers. The thing is, it's not a done deal that that means you have to do memory management by hand. If you new something you must either then take responsibility of following it around for the rest of its life to see if you should delete it or, the smart thing, immediately put it in a shared_ptr or a unique_ptr, a smart pointer from the Standard Library. When you immediately put it in a smart pointer you never have to delete it. The scope and the lifetime of that smart pointer, which is just a local object, an object on the stack, will control the lifetime of your free store memory and the destructor and all of the things associated with cleaning up. That's the smart thing to do. Smart developers use smart pointers. Manual memory management is hard. Smart pointers make your life simpler. I've shown you the hard way because I think you should know, not because I think you should run out and write the big three in all your classes for the rest of time. The smart thing to do is not to have to do that.\n",

      "Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general purpose programming language, C++. In this module I'll talk about polymorphism in C++. Now, polymorphism doesn't sneak up on you. It can only happen when you have classes that inherit from other classes and new pointers. It's actually an incredibly useful and productive technique. When you get to talk about polymorphism and pointers to objects and base classes and drive classes you have other pieces of vocabulary like, virtual, slicing, casting. You know, to really get the C++ pointers story you need to explore what happens with pointers to objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy, so let's do that.\n",

      "Pointers are straightforward when the objects that you have a pointer to are just flat objects with no base class. So far, you've seen pointers to integers, to Person, to Resource. When you have an inheritance hierarchy then you have to understand the rules around pointers to a base class and pointers to a derived class. When you do an object-oriented design you often use the test sentence, is a. So imagine a hierarchy where I have a base class BankAccount, and some drive classes, CheckingAccount, and SavingAccount. It's about a 30-year-old example, but it's a goody. A CheckingAccount is a BankAccount; a savings account is a BankAccount; and if some function takes a BankAccount pointer, you can pass down a savings account pointer, or a CheckingAccount pointer, and that function shouldn't complain in any way. It's a Liskov substitutability and in C++ it's done with pointers. The function takes a BankAccount pointer. I give it a CheckingAccount pointer. It thinks of it as a BankAccount pointer, stores it in that base class pointer, and then, obviously, calls only base class functions using the pointer. I haven't designed BankAccount. I just started talking about it, but imagine it's got GetBalance. That's a function in the base class. It will be in the drived classes. Both CheckingAccount and SavingAccount will have a GetBalance and so, this code that expects a BankAccount pointer can go ahead and call GetBalance in total confidence. It's guaranteed to work, but a question arises. What code will run? In a lot of languages you may think you know the answer. Oh, it's the more derived implementation in the subclass. In C++ it's up to the programmer. You decide when you write BankAccount whether GetBalance is virtual or not. If it's virtual then the derived class version of the function will run, so SavingAccount GetBalance or CheckingAccount GetBalance, but if the author of BankAccount made GetBalance non-virtual, which is the default because it's the fastest, then only the BankAccount version will be executed, even when the object in question is really a SavingsAccount or really a CheckingAccount. You as the developer get to choose whether you want virtual functions or non-virtual functions. In C++ virtual functions are implemented through a virtual table, which is a little collection of memory that has the name of the function and where to find the code for it. You don't really care and, in fact, the standard doesn't insist on it working this way, but the point is, at runtime there's a little bit of a cost of figuring out what function to run, and your program is a little bit bigger because of the memory taken up by the virtual table. If your class has no virtual functions at all it will be a little bit smaller and run a little faster, and, in some cases, people want that, so you get to choose virtual or not virtual. Now, this relationship based in derived only works in one direction, so you can't take a BankAccount pointer and hand it to something that's expecting a CheckingAccount pointer. That's not fair. Checking accounts might have, I don't know, overdraft limit and your bank account doesn't have that, so a pointer to an actual bank account can only be given to code that's expecting an actual bank account, not to something expecting a checking account, but a pointer to a checking account can always be given to code expecting a bank account because a checking account is a bank account. Interestingly, when you use smart pointers, like shared_ptr and unique_ptr, you can get this same polymorphism preserved, exactly the same behavior as if you were using raw pointers. Since I consider using smart pointers to be a best practice, I want to make sure that you know you're not giving anything up when you use them in an inheritance hierarchy.\n",

      "We've been using the Person and Tweeter hierarchy throughout this material. Let's use it again. Here I have a very simple console app that's going to create some pointers to Person objects and Tweeter objects, and it's going to make a bunch of method calls on those pointers. There are a lot of different versions of Person kicking around, depending on what I want to demonstrate. Let me just quickly show you the header file for Person. It just has firstname, lastname, arbitrarynumber, doesn't really have any operator overloads or anything much going on, and has some Get and Set functions here -- GetName, GetNumber, SetNumber, and SetFirstName -- and these are just easy functions for me to call and see what happens within the class. Tweeter inherits from Person and has this overload of GetName. Any two functions with the same name we call overloading, even if they're in entirely different and unrelated classes, so we have operator overloads and this is certainly an overload. We have GetName here in Person and in Tweeter, and there's been a number of objects and classes showing up over time in demos with GetName functions in them. With GetName, in addition to being an overload, is also an override. I want the Tweeter GetName to be somehow different from the Person GetName, so let's be reminded of what the Person's GetName does. It just returns the firstname and then a space and then the lastname. In here we have an attempt at writing a Tweeter GetName. We'll go with the firstname, the lastname, and the twitterhandle, but you notice there are red wiggles. If I hover over them they say, Error, Personlastname bla bla bla bla bla is inaccessible, and the same for Personfirstname, inaccessible. Let's go back to Person. Right. They're private. Private member variables are not accessible by any code outside the class. I have a couple of options for how to make this right. One, would be to add individual GetFirstName and GetLastName public functions to Person for no other reason than to let Tweeter call them. That's a bad idea. I see people do it a lot, but it's a bad idea. Another would be to change this private to protected. (Typing) Protected is a language keyword that says it's private unless the code is in a class that inherits from this class, then it can do what it likes and party on the data. I consider protected to be a to-do list. Right now GetName returns firstname space lastname, but if you have a business requirement to suddenly change that to lastname comma space firstname, if these variables are protected, you're going to have to go looking for GetName elsewhere in classes that inherit from Person and depending on your platform architecture it may be a challenge to find all the classes that inherit from Person and change them to print out first names and last names the new, approved way. My preference: leave this private and use this perfectly good GetName function that's already been written. That way, if anyone ever changes GetName in the base class we'll get the changed behavior in the derived class, much smarter. I'll just go back into Tweeter.cpp take these, and what I want is to call Person's GetName. (Typing) Where am I going to get a Person object to use the dot syntax on, some pdot GetName? Well, I don't have one, but I can still call it from in here by using its full name. (Typing) Return Person GetName. Now, I'm in a position where if someone makes a change in the base class I'll just naturally get that change in the derived class. I don't have to worry about private and protected anymore. I'm not trying to talk to private variables. This is all good. That makes my project compile, but that wasn't really what we came here for, right? We really came here to see what happens if I talk to some objects using different kinds of pointers, so let's go back and look at this in main. I'm creating a Person on the free store and, by the way, forgetting to delete it. It's a deliberate memory leak here. I'm creating a Tweeter, also on the free store, which I do remember to delete, and I'm creating a Person pointer that's equal to this Tweeter pointer, so just two ways of looking at the same piece of memory out on the free store. And then, I'm going to call GetName on the Kate pointer that I got from newing up a Person on the KateGregcons pointer, which is a Tweeter pointer that I got from newing up a Tweeter, and on the pKateGregcons, which is a Person pointer that came from newing up a Tweeter. Remember that the Person GetName just prints their name; the Tweeter GetName prints their handle as well. Let's run this, and here's what happens. When I use the Person pointer, which is pointing to a real Person object, not surprisingly, I get Person output. When I use the Tweeter pointer, which is pointing to a real Tweeter object, not surprisingly, I get Tweeter output. When I use a Person pointer, which is really pointing to a Tweeter, I get Person output. Some of you might have expected differently, but GetName in Person.h is not virtual, and because it's not virtual I will always get Person output. If I want to see a Tweeter code for GetName run even when I'm using a Person pointer, as long as it's really a Tweeter object that the Person pointer is pointing to, I need to make GetName virtual. Now, I'll only need to do this here in the base class. I don't need to do it in Tweeter. You can if you want as a form of documentation. And I don't need to do it throughout all of the inheritance hierarchy. I can just make this single change here and then just run it, and you see now the Tweeter code ran even though we were using a Person pointer because it really points to a Tweeter object, and when the function's virtual that's what drives it. Once I have a virtual function in Person I will have a virtual table and I will take that small performance hit. At that point, a rule kicks in. Now it's not a compiler rule. I don't have any warnings from the compiler. This is a best practices rule. I want you to kind of go on a thought experiment with me. Imagine that I new this Tweeter up and I don't call delete using the Tweeter pointer, but instead I call delete using the Person pointer that points to the same place. The destructor for Person and Tweeter is currently non-virtual. Here is a destructor. This destructor actually doesn't do anything and we'd be better off taking it away, but bear with me. We have this destructor; it's not virtual. If instead of deleting the Tweeter pointer, we called delete on the Person pointer, you know what would happen? The Person destructor would run. So what? Well, it depends on the class. If Tweeter manages something, like it opens a file, and its destructor needs to close the file, and I delete a Tweeter object using a Person pointer, I still want to run the Tweeter destructor. I still want to close the file or release the lock or let go of the database connection or whatever my destructor's going to do. How can I prevent this leak where we called the wrong destructor? How can I be sure that if the object being deleted is really a Tweeter object that the Tweeter destructor runs? By having the destructor be virtual. Now some people go so far as to say that all destructors should be virtual. (Typing) I don't agree with that. That just makes the overhead of virtual functions come into every class whether they're needed or not, but a really good rule is the minute you have one virtual function, clearly you're expecting to be using pointers and an inheritance hierarchy, and for virtuality to matter. There's a really good chance that somebody might call delete on a Person pointer that was really pointing to a Tweeter object, and despite the fact that as the Person author I have no idea what might get added to Tweeter, I feel safest making the destructor virtual at this point. Don't make the destructor virtual before there are any other virtual functions, but the minute there's one virtual function get in there and make the destructor virtual. It will save you from a really subtle bug that is extraordinarily hard to track down if you don't just happen to recognize this pattern and this best practice.\n",

      "Let's change this demo from using raw pointers, Person* and Tweeter*, to using shared_ptrs. I'll include memory. (Typing) That brings me in the shared_ptr and since I already have using namespace std I can just call it shared_ptr. Let's (Typing) make a shared_ptr (Typing) of Person (Typing), and call it shared pointer to Kate. And there's a couple different ways -- we used to make shared in other demos because we weren't declaring and initializing the pointer at the same time. Here, I can, if I wish, simply new up a Person and put it in here or I can use =make_shared (Typing) at Person (Typing) and again, pass in those arguments. I'm just going to steal these arguments (Typing) and I'll put an S and a P. We're not going to be very pronounceable, but we'll be able to tell our objects apart. (Typing) This line of code compiles. I'll build it to prove it to you, but it's a little repetitive. Why do I have to say the type here and here? Interestingly, make_shared a Person returns a shared_ptr of Person and in C++ 11 we have this cool capability, which is, I don't have to type out the type of an object if the compiler knows what it is. Here, I can actually use this C++ 11 keyword, auto. When I do that, if I hover over spKate, you'll see it's a shared_ptr of Person. It has a type; I just didn't have to come up with it. Its type is whatever make_shared returns. I can, of course, interact with this pointer the same way we did with the raw ones. So I could take this line, (Typing) paste it here, and all I need to do is change the variable to spKate, and that's just fine. I'm dereferencing the shared_ptr to call its GetName function. I could also go back to calling this a shared_ptr (Typing) to Person, but create it, not by calling make_shared of Person, but by calling make_shared of Tweeter. So this will now be a shared_ptr to Person that's actually pointing to an object that was allocated out on the free store as a Tweeter. I'm going to need another parameter to my constructor for a twitter handle. (Typing) And if I run this you can see I got the Tweeter version of GetName. In other words, our shared_ptrs are being appropriately polymorphic. A shared_ptr of Person that really points at a Person, you get the Person code. No surprise there. A shared_ptr of Person that really points at a Tweeter, you get the Tweeter code because it's a virtual function. It just works exactly like a raw pointer.\n",

      "I mentioned that a lot of this passing a CheckingAccount to something that's expecting a BankAccount has to be with pointers. The reason is because when you copy solid objects around you get something known as slicing. If I take a CheckingAccount that has a balance, and who owns it, and all that contact information, as well as an overdraft limit, and I copy it into a BankAccount object that doesn't have a place to keep overdraft limit, the absolutely best thing that can happen is that the overdraft limit will just get thrown away because there's no place to put it. The worst thing that'll happen is some kind of runtime error. So you can take a CheckingAccount pointer and give it to something expecting a BankAccount pointer. That's fine, but if you take an entire solid CheckingAccount and give it to something that's expecting a BankAccount, you're going to lose some of the CheckingAccount information. That's not necessarily an error, but it is if you then want to try to, somehow, get some virtual behavior where you'll see the use of the derived class's member variables. There is no derived class anymore and those member variables are gone. Similarly, you can't take a BankAccount and copy it into a CheckingAccount because there's information missing from that base class that's' needed in the derived class. We do simple demos where we declare things and set them equal to things, but as I've said many times before, what really happens in live C++ programs is that things are being copied back and forth to functions because functions are what your app is built of. If your function takes things by value, and the types are different, either the copying will entirely fail or slicing will happen, depending on which direction you're going in. Slicing's bad because you're throwing information away, and certainly copies failing is also bad, and that's why it's so common not to pass by value, but to pass by reference or to use pointers. References use the same syntax as solid objects, use the dot instead of the arrow. Some people find them a little easier to read. Polymorphically, there's no real difference between references and pointers. The same rules apply about, oh I'm expecting a BankAccount reference, sure, here, have a CheckingAccount reference, and that's why people use references and pointers when they're passing things around to functions.\n",

      "Let's go back into this same project and add some code that copies some objects around so you can see some slicing and some compiler error messages. In the interest of not watching me type, I'll just quickly paste this in. Here I'm creating a local Person in local storage, passing the parameters into the constructor as always. This is fine. There's no problem with this line. On the next line I'm trying to create a Tweeter locally and initialize it by just copying that Person into it. And you see that the error here is, no suitable user-defined conversion from Person to Tweeter exists. It can make a Person from a Person; it can make a Tweeter from a Tweeter, but in order to make a Tweeter from a Person I would have to write some code to teach it how to do that because what are we going to use for the twitter handle? Let's come in at the other way then. Since that's not going to work let's make a local Tweeter (Typing) and (Typing) make up a twitter handle, and again, apologies if that's anybody's real twitter handle, and then let's make a Person (Typing) from that (Typing) and then I'll use its GetName. (Typing) What actually happens when this runs is that we copy the firstname, the lastname, and the arbitrarynumber from localT2 into localP2 and throw away the twitterhandle, since we have no place to put it. When we call GetName it calls the Person version of GetName. (Typing) Just says Local Tweeter. There is no handle and that's because the handle is long gone. Now one way around this would be, I could've made this a Person pointer; I could've asked for the address of local2; (Typing) and I could have switched from the dot notation (Typing) to the arrow notation. That'll compile, but it's a lot of work, especially if I had more than one line of code. Plus, that's a raw pointer. Maybe I should be using a shared_ptr. Here's a nicer way to get polymorphism while still keeping this syntax. I can make this a Person reference. One character I type. Run it. Now I get the Tweeter version of the function even though I use the Person reference, and that's because references are polymorphic in the same way that pointers are polymorphic. And I didn't have to go around with stars and ampersands and arrows and all of the things that start to get people sort of punctuation-tense. It's okay. Just make it a Person reference. It's a polymorphic reference. It'll use the Tweeter GetName when I call the function. Same thing happens if you take a function that takes a Person by reference and you actually give it a Tweeter, and then it happens to call some member functions of Tweeter. That's what we'll run, Tweeter member functions, even though the code that's running thinks it's calling Person member functions. Course, they have to be functions that were defined in Person and furthermore, were defined as virtual in Person, not just an extra thing like tweet that you added to Tweeter. It has to be something from Person like GetName, but then you will get the behavior you want.\n",

      "nline: 42\n",
      "lines: \n",
      "I want to go back to casting again. A long, long time ago I showed you how to cast with the round brackets. You have a floating point number and you write round bracket int, round bracket, and then the floating point number, and then that casts it to an integer, maybe throws away the part of the number that was after the decimal point. You don't get a warning because hey, you told the compiler you knew what you were doing. You can use round casts to go back and forth between different kinds of pointers, different kinds of references, but it's kind of a dangerous thing to do. There's nothing to check to see that it's okay what you're doing, and when someone else reads over your code they may not understand what you're doing or why you're doing it, and very often people end up putting comments like, this is okay because I know it actually has a Tweeter in it. There are better casts available to you, and now that you understand template syntax, you can use them. Here is the static_cast. It's a template. It's an operator called static_cast, angle bracket, whatever you want to cast to, and it's done at compile time. If, at compile time, the compiler doesn't see a relationship between what something's really pointing to and what you're trying to cast it to, or in the case of numbers, the kind of number it really holds, and the kind of number you're trying to cast it to, you will get a warning, or in some cases, an error that they're incompatible. But if it could sometimes hold this kind of information, and could sometimes hold that kind of information, you can be tripped up by a static_cast because there are no runtime checks to help you out. The dynamic_cast has a runtime check and the runtime check relies on knowing what the type is at runtime. It's restricted to working with pointers to objects of classes that have virtual tables. The cool thing about a dynamic_cast is that when you're trying to cast to a pointer, if it doesn't work, because at runtime it can be established that, that's not really pointing to a Tweeter, you get back a nullptr and you can test against a nullptr. If you're trying to cast to a reference it'll throw an exception. That's okay too. They're slower, to use the dynamic_cast, but it's safer. You won't ever misinterpret bits and cause really weird bugs of the kind that you can get when you misuse a static_cast. Now, for the sake of completeness, I'll also mention const_cast. I'm not showing you the exact syntax here. This is where you can actually take a const variable and cast it to a not-const variable so you can change it. As you can imagine, not a beginner technique. Sometimes people will do this to handle caches and things like that, where you're not really changing the object. There are other ways to do it. Anyway, not for beginners. Reinterpret_cast is totally not for beginners. This is a matter of bit-twiddling. This involves knowing how long certain data types are and the pattern of bits inside the data type, and you say, oh yeah, I think of that as being an integer, and then you put some values in, and then you say, now I'm going to think of it as being something completely different and ask about its value, and the bits will be interpreted differently; the meaning will be interpreted differently. There is old code that uses reinterpret_cast, but what I really use it as is a huge red flag to say, wait a minute, someone's trying to be really smart here. Is that actually necessary? That's one of the ways that casts can really express your intent. A static_cast is nice and safe between two related types and you're really confident that this Person pointer actually points to a Tweeter, so you just feel like casting it to a Tweeter so you can call some Tweeter function. Yeah. Dynamic_cast, a little less safe, a little bit of a runtime performance hit, but you will be checked on, and you will be protected. Const_cast, very dangerous, and reinterpret_cast, extraordinarily dangerous. This is the shooting your own foot off territory of C++ and that's why I'm not going to teach you how to do it. I want you to know that it's there. If you see these casts in someone else's code, tread carefully.\n",

      "Let's do some casting back and forth between base and derived and see where that gets us to. (Typing) Here's some code, again using Person and Tweeter, and I'll just show you that in Person the GetName function is virtual, so that here, when you see calls in main to GetName, you know that we're expecting to get the Tweeter version if the pointer really points to a Tweeter object, and the Person version when the pointer really points to the Person object, regardless of the type of the pointer. You can see what's happening here. I'm going to create a Tweeter on the stack, make a Person pointer by taking its address, and then I'm trying to take a Tweeter pointer by just using the Person pointer and I have wigglies here. A value of type Person* cannot be used to initialize an entity of type Tweeter*, and in fact, if I build this code, I'm going to get an actually pretty insightful error message, which says, cast from base to derived requires dynamic_cast or static_cast. I'm trying to go from the base Person to the derived Tweeter and we can see that's true because we know that Person's pointing to T, which is really a Tweeter, so we know this is safe, but the compiler is not so sure. Now, one way around this, I can use the round bracket cast. (Typing) Red wigglies go away, and this code will run, and I get the Tweeter version with the twitter handle, so I'm like, woo, I win. I used round bracket casting and I lived. It doesn't really explain our intent and it can really hurt you. Let me show you how this can really hurt you. I'm going to declare an integer (Typing) and then (Typing) I'm going to declare a Tweeter pointer, pointer to i is equal to (Typing) hey, cast this to a Tweeter pointer would you? The address of i. Compiler's like well, I guess you know what you're doing. You said round bracket cast, which means get off my case; I know what I want. So let's just copy this line, (Typing) only instead of pt we'll use pi, our freshly-minted Tweeter pointer that's pointing to a supposedly Tweeter. I guess you know this is not going to end well. Boom, and of course it goes boom. Right? I mean i is not a Tweeter. It doesn't have an implementation of GetName. It doesn't have a firstname, a lastname, a twitterhandle, anything. There's no way this could possibly work, but I said that I knew what I was doing. That's why we say sometimes that if C++ had a motto it would be, well you're the programmer or, when we're feeling really kind of darker humor, it's your foot. You're sure you want me to pull this trigger? Okay. It's not my foot; it's your foot. And as the programmer I don't want to shoot my foot off even though compiler will let me, so why use round brackets which don't check anything? Let's instead use a static_cast. So up here, the good one, I say, static_cast, angle brackets. I want to cast it to a Tweeter pointer, and then I put round brackets around the thing I want to cast. My angle bracket's the wrong direction. There we go. Static_cast to a Tweeter pointer p. Let's try it out down here. (Typing) Static_cast to a Tweeter pointer, address of i. (Typing) No red wigglies here. Red wigglies here. Invalid type conversion. Let's try to build. Types pointed to are unrelated. Yes, that's exactly the problem. So this was a really stupid piece of code to write, and you know what? Using static_cast saved me from myself and told me, wow that was stupid. Why did you want to do that? So static_cast will save me from myself. Sometimes what people would like to do is try a dynamic_cast instead. Now, the dynamic_cast won't object at compile time. What it'll do, is if it can't make the conversion, it will give you back a nullptr, which you can test. You notice I'm getting wiggles here. That's because you can't use a dynamic_cast with a fundamental type like int or even with certain kinds of classes. The class has to have a virtual function. I have good old Resource in here. This is a handy class to keep kicking around and it has a virtual function, so I can try to cast a Resource to a Tweeter, which would still be pretty catastrophic, so I'll create myself a local Resource, (Typing) passing (Typing) local into the constructor, and so, I'll still try to dynamically cast to a Tweeter, but I'll use the address of this Resource f instead of my integer. Let's try running. First I'll build it. Compiles without complaint. When I tried to do static_cast between totally unrelated types I got an error message. Try to do dynamic_cast, I'm like, ha ha, I got away with something, eh? So, let's run it. It turns out I didn't really get away with it and you know, this is why I say that the compiler is your friend. I would rather get my error messages as red wigglies right while I'm typing code or at least as compiler error messages when I try to build, than after I run, especially for a real app that takes a long time to run. These console apps just spin right out, but you have some big, complicated gooey; you have to click six buttons to do a test case; choose things from dropdowns, wait while database connections go through, da da da, and then it goes boom? I would much rather get my problem pointed out to me, handed to me, by the compiler. That said, I can prevent it from blowing up at all because I told you when a dynamic_cast fails you get back a nullptr. So I can take the bad behavior and say, if pi, in other words, if it's a true value, then I will try to call its GetName. Its i successfully converted it to a Tweeter. Great, I'll call a Tweeter code on it. Else, (Typing) I'll say something else like, resource can't be cast to Tweeter. (Typing) Let's run that. (Typing) Not surprisingly, it says resource can't be cast to tweeter, but let's recap. When we used round bracket casting I could cast integers to Tweeters and make my app blow up. When I used static casting it was just as sweet and useful for the good, proper, appropriate casting. We all know here that p really is pointing to a Tweeter, so this is an appropriate cast. Everything went swimmingly well. The static_cast refused to let me cast between integers and Tweeters or between Resources and Tweeters. Dynamic_cast didn't give me a compile error and gave me a way to check at runtime to make sure that this was okay to do. If someone's going to hand you a pointer, or a reference, and you're not sure whether or not it's maybe one of the derived types, you can try casting it using the dynamic_cast, and if it works, great. It really is the derived class, so you can go ahead and call methods on it. Doesn't work? No harm done, just don't do the work. That's how static_cast and dynamic_cast can save you from yourself, and they're what you should be using instead of round bracket cast.\n",

      "lines: \n",
      "Now, when it comes to pointers, you really kind of know the rest of this story, the polymorphism story. This lets you write really general code. I will be given a collection of BankAccount pointers -- they might be smart pointers, doesn't matter, right? And I will update them all or if they're orders, I'll ship them, or for employees, I'll pay them, whatever. These sorts of constructs are all over your code and they'll call methods through the pointer. Very general methods that are defined in the base class, like update or ship or pay, but the implementations that run will be the specific methods for updating a checking account or updating a savings account, for shipping a rush order or shipping a regular order, for paying a part time employee or paying a full time employee. They'll have very different implementations, but thanks to polymorphism, your calling code stays really nice and general. Yeah, take that BankAccount pointer and call its update method. With raw pointers you get polymorphism. With smart pointers you get polymorphism. With references you get polymorphism. You don't try to decide which of those to use based on whether or not you're going to get polymorphism because you're going to get it. When you're not using pointers or references or smart pointers, when you're using solid objects and copying them around, either the way we did in the demos with equal signs, or more realistically, by calling some function that takes its parameters by value. When you take a derived object and copy it onto a base object you get slicing. You lose the member variables that are unique to the derived class. That's almost never a good thing. When you use a pointer you lose nothing. You still get polymorphic behavior on that pointer, and if you cast it back to the derived class later, you can then continue to call derived class functions using the pointer. You can do a lot of casting with the round bracket, C-style cast, but I don't recommend it. I recommend, for safety and for expressiveness, that you use the cast templates, especially static_cast and dynamic_cast. Stay away from const_cast and reinterpret_cast, at least for now. In order to understand this topic, pointers, polymorphism, and inheritance, we had to cover the full gamut from your fundamental types like int and float and casting amongst them, designing and defining and declaring objects, and writing functions of objects, all of the operators and arithmetic that make up flow of control statements to make a C++ application, and then tackle templates and pointers and the combination pointers and inheritance to get polymorphism, as well as the benefit you see from smart pointers and these cast operators, both of which rely on templates to work. This topic is sort of the pinnacle of what parts of C++ do you still need to understand? If you really followed all of this then you understand casting, you understand pointers, you understand inheritance, you understand templates. You understand C++, so congratulations. Now you're ready to do some very, very cool things.\n",

      "Welcome to Python Fundamentals. My name is Austin Bingham and over the coming modules myself and Robert Smallshire will guide you through the basics of the Python programming language. Python is a big language, and a single course can't possibly cover everything there is to know, but this course will serve you well as a solid foundation for becoming productive with Python. Python Fundamentals is the first in our trilogy of three Pluralsight courses which cover the core Python language. This course serves as the foundation for our Python - Beyond the Basics and Advanced Python courses. Our courses follow a thoughtfully designed spiral curriculum. We visit the same or closely related topics several times in increasing depth, sometimes multiple times in the same course. For example, later in Python Fundamentals, we will cover classes and single inheritance. In Python - Beyond the Basics, we cover multiple class inheritance. In the Advanced Python course, we cover what amounts to a type of virtual inheritance using Python's sophisticated abstract base class mechanism. In Python Fundamentals, we'll cover basic techniques you'll use constantly on your journey with Python. Starting in this module, we'll give a high-level overview of the Python language, what it is, and what's so great about it. We'll also give a bird's-eye view of the rest of this course so that you'll have an idea of what's to come.\n",

      "First, what's so great about Python? Why do you want to learn it? There are lots of good answers to those questions. One, is that Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive so you can create solutions quickly, and others can understand them easily. Often, you won't need to write much code because Python comes with a great standard library, and it's the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. This is much of what makes Python so hugely popular across the diverse realms of web development, scientific computing, cloud configuration, data science, and education. Python has taken a prominent position in web development providing the back ends for high-traffic sites including YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, and Dropbox using Python web framework such as Django, Flask, or Pyramid. Python has become the leading environment for scientific computing, the specialist libraries ranging from Astropy to Biopython built on the foundations for fast numerical computing provided by NumPy and general scientific analysis with SciPy. Python plays an important role in deploying systems to the cloud with Python-based tools like Ansible, for configuration management, Boto, for Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft's Azure Software Development Kit for Python. Python technologies are at the center of a revolution in financial and other analytical fields thanks to wonderful tools for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning in the shape of Pandas, Matplotlib, Bokeh, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. As you can see, with Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications. You can do it quickly, you can do it safely, and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible, but that's just one part of what makes Python great. Another is that Python is wonderfully open. It's open source so you can get to know every aspect of it if you want. At the same time, Python is hugely popular and has a great community to support you when you run into trouble. This combination of openness and large user base means that almost anyone, from casual programmers to professional software developers can engage with the language at the level they need. But for many people, these reasons take backseat to something more important, Python is fun. Python's expressive, readable style, quick edit/run development cycle, and batteries-included philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. And Python will grow with you. As your experiments become prototypes, and your prototypes become products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but truly enjoyable. In the words of Randall Munroe, \"Come join us! \"Programming is fun again.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "This course is broken up into ten separate modules. The modules build on one another so unless you've already had some exposure to Python, you'll need to follow them in order. We'll start with getting Python installed into your system and orienting you a bit. We'll then cover language elements, features, idioms, and libraries all driven by working examples that you'll be able to build along with the lecture. We are firm believers that you'll learn more by doing than just by watching so we encourage you to run the examples yourself. By the end of the course, you'll know the fundamentals of the Python language. You'll also know how to use third-party libraries, and you'll know the basics of developing them yourself. We'll even show you how to package up your code to make it easier for others to use what you've written. The course modules are: One, Getting Started, where we cover installing Python, look at some of the basic Python tools, and cover the core elements of the language and syntax. Two, Strings & Collections, where we look at some of the fundamental complex data types, strings, byte sequences, lists, and dictionaries. Three, Modularity, where we look at the tools Python has for structuring your code such as functions and modules. Four, Built-in Types and The Object Model, where we examine Python's type system and object system in detail, and where we develop a strong sense of Python's reference semantics. Five, Collection Types, where we go into more depth on some of the Python Collection Types as well as introduce a few more. Six, Handling Exceptions, where we learn about Python's exception handling system and the central role that exceptions play in the language. Seven, Comprehensions, Iterables and Generators, where we explore the elegant, pervasive, and powerful sequence-oriented parts of Python such as comprehensions and generator functions. Eight, defining new types with Classes, where we'll cover developing your own complex data types in Python using classes to support object-oriented programming. Nine, Files and Resource Management, where we'll look how to look at files in Python, and where we'll cover the tools Python has for resource management. Ten, Shipping Working and Maintainable Code, where we'll show you how to use Python's testing, debugging, and code distribution facilities to produce code that works and can be used by others.

      "So what is Python? Simply put, Python is a programming language. It was initially developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s in the Netherlands. Guido continues to be actively involved in guiding the development and evolution of the language, so much so that he's been given the title Benevolent Dictator For Life or more commonly BDFL. Python is developed as an open source project, and is free to download and use as you wish. The non-profit Python Software Foundation manages Python's intellectual property and plays a strong role in promoting the language and, in some cases, funding its development. On a technical level, Python is a strongly typed language in the sense that every object in the language has a definite type, and there's generally no way to circumvent that type. At the same time, Python is dynamically-typed meaning that there's no type checking of your code prior to running it. This is in contrast to statically-typed languages like C++ or Java, where a compiler does a lot of type checking for you, rejecting programs which misuse objects. Ultimately, the best description of the Python-type system is that it uses duck typing where an object's suitability for a context is only determined at run time. We'll cover this in more detail in Module Eight. Python is a general purpose programming language. It's not intended for use in any particular domain or environment, but instead can be fruitfully used for a wide variety of tasks. There are of course some areas where it's less suitable than others, for example, in extremely time sensitive or memory constrained environments, but, for the most part, Python is as flexible and adaptable as any modern programming language and more so than most. Python is an interpreted language. This is a bit of a misstatement technically because Python is normally compiled into a form of byte code before it's executed; however this compilation happens invisibly, and the experience of using Python is one of immediately executing code without a noticeable compilation phase. This lack of an interruption between editing and running is one of the great joys of working with Python. The syntax of Python is designed to be clear, readable, and expressive. Unlike many popular languages, Python uses white space to delimit code blocks and, in the process, does away with reams of unnecessary parentheses while enforcing a universal layout. This means that all Python looks alike in important ways, and you can learn to read Python very quickly. At the same time, Python's expressive syntax means that you can get a lot of meaning into a single line of code. This expressive, highly readable code means that Python maintenance is relatively easy. There are multiple implementations of the Python language. The original and still by far the most common implementation is written in C. This version is commonly referred to as CPython. When someone talks about running Python, it's normally safe to assume that they are talking about C Python, and this is the implementation that we'll be using for this course. Other implementations of Python include Jython which is written to target the Java virtual machine, IronPython which targets the .NET Runtime, and PyPy which is written in a specialized subset of Python called RPython. These implementations generally trail behind CPython which is considered to be the standard for the language. Much of what you will learn in this course will apply to all of these implementations. There are two important versions of the Python language in common use right now, Python 2, and Python 3. These two versions represent changes in some key elements of the language, and code written for one will not generally work for the other unless you take special precautions. Python 2 is older and more well established than Python 3, but Python 3 addresses some known shortcomings in the older version. Python 3 is the definite future of Python, and you should use it if at all possible. While there are some critical differences between Python 2 and 3, most of the fundamentals of the two versions are the same. If you learn one, most of what you know transfers cleanly to the other. In this course, we'll be teaching Python 3, but we'll point out important differences between the versions when necessary.\n",

      "Python Overview, Part 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond being a programming language, Python comes with a powerful and broad standard library. Part of the Python philosophy is Batteries Included, meaning that you can use Python for many complex, real-world tasks out of the box, with no need to install third-party packages. This is not only extremely convenient, but it means that it's easier to get started learning Python using interesting engaging examples, something we aim for in this course. Another great effect of the batteries-included approach is that it means that many scripts, even non-trivial ones, can be run immediately on any Python installation. This removes a common annoying barrier to installing software that you face with some languages. The standard library has a generally high level of good documentation. APRS are well documented, and the modules often have good narrative descriptions with quick start guides, best practice information, and so forth. The standard library documentation is always available online at python.org, and you can install it locally if you need to. As the standard library is such an important part of Python, we'll be covering parts of it throughout this course. Even so, we won't be covering more than a small fraction of it so you're encouraged to explore it on your own. Finally, no description of Python would be complete without mentioning that to many people, Python represents a philosophy for writing code. Principles of clarity and readability are part of what it means to write correct or Pythonic code. It's not always clear what Pythonic means in all circumstances, and sometimes there may be no single correct way to write something, but the fact that the Python community is concerned about issues like simplicity, readability, and explicitness means that Python code tends to be more, well, beautiful. Many of Python's principles are embodied in the so-called Zen of Python. The Zen isn't a hardened fast set of rules, but rather a set of guidelines or touchstones to keep in mind when coding. When you find yourself trying to decide between several courses of action, these principles can often give you a nudge in the right direction. We'll be highlighting elements from The Zen of Python throughout this course. We think Python is a great language, and we're excited to help you get started with it. By the time you get through this course, you'll be able to write substantial Python programs, and you'll be able to read even more complex ones. More importantly, you'll have the foundation you need to go out and discover all the more advanced topics in the language, and hopefully, we'll get you excited enough about Python to actually do so. Python is a big language with a huge ecosystem of software built in and around it, and it can be a real adventure to discover everything it has to offer. So welcome to Python! We'll see you in the next module.\n",

      "Welcome to the second module of this Python Fundamentals course by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham. My name is Robert Smallshire and I'll be presenting this Getting Started module. In this module, we'll cover obtaining and installing Python on your system for Windows, Ubuntu Linux, and Mac OS. We'll write some basic Python code and become acquainted with the essentials of Python programming culture such as The Zen of Python, though we'll never forget the origins of the name of the language. There are two major versions of the Python language. Python 2, which is the widely deployed legacy language and Python 3, which is the present and future of the language. It's now over a decade since the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 was begun and we strongly recommend that all new projects be begun with Python 3, as Python 2 will not maintained from the year 2020. That said, most of the Python code we'll demonstrate will work without modification between the last version of Python 2, which is Python 2.7 and recent versions of Python 3, such as Python 3.6. However, there are some key differences and in a strict sense, the languages are incompatible. We'll be using Python 3 for this course and everything we show will work on Python 3.3 or later. We're also confident that everything we present will apply to future versions of Python 3, so don't be afraid to try those as they become available. Before we can start programming in Python, we need to get hold of a Python environment. Python is a highly portable language available on all major operating systems. You'll be able to complete this course on Windows, Mac, or Linux and the only major section where we diverge into platform specifics is coming right up, as we install Python 3. Feel free to skip over the sections which aren't relevant to you, although we'll only spend a minute or two on each.\n",

      "Let's see how to install Python 3 on Windows 10. For Windows, you need to visit the official Python website at python.org and then, navigate via the Downloads tab to the Downloads for Windows and click the button to begin downloading the latest Python 3 version. When given the option, choose to run the Installer. After the Installer starts, be sure to enable the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable before moving on, by clicking Install Now. You may be asked to approve the Python Installer making changes to your device, which you should accept. After a few seconds, the Installer will complete and you can close the Installer and your web browser. We'll be working with Python from the command-line, so via the Context Menu on the Start button choose Windows PowerShell. On older versions of Windows, you may need to use the CMD Shell instead. And start Python just by typing python, followed by Enter. Welcome to Python. The triple arrow prompt shows you that Python is waiting for your input.

Navigate via the Downloads tab to the Downloads for Mac OS and click the button to begin downloading the latest Python 3 version. A package file downloads, which when opened launches the Python Installer. Continue through the install process, accepting the license agreement and using the default installation location. You may need to provide your password as you go. Although Mac OS does include a Python interpreter, it's the legacy Python 2.7 version and for this course, we use Python 3. The Python 3 version we're installing here will sit along side the system Python 2 and won't interfere with the correct operation of your Mac. When Python is installed, you can clean up by moving the Installer to the Trash. To use Python, open a terminal. Here, we're using Spotlight to do so, and run Python 3 from the command-line.

In the terminal, you should be able to start Python 3. Welcome to Python. The triple arrow prompt shows you that Python is waiting for your input.

      "\n",
      "The Read-Eval-Print-Loop or REPL\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that Python is installed and running, we can immediately start using it interactively. This is a good way to get to know the language as well as a useful tool for experimentation and quick-testing during normal development. The Python command-line environment is a Read-Eval-Print-Loop. Python will read whatever we type in, evaluate it, print the result, and then loop back to the beginning. You'll often hear it referred to as, simply, the REPL. When started, the REPL will print some information about the version of Python you are running and then, it will give you a triple arrow prompt. This prompt tells you that Python is waiting for you to type something. Within an interactive Python session, you can enter fragments of Python programs and see instant results. Let's start with some simple arithmetic. Two plus two is four and six times seven is 42. As you can see, Python reads our input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops round to do the same again. We can assign variables in the REPL, such as x equals five, and print their contents simply by typing their name. We can refer to variables in expressions. Here, we do three times x. Within the REPL, you can use the special underscore variable to refer to the most recently printed value. This being one of very few obscure shortcuts in Python. Or you can use the special underscore variable in an expression. Remember, though, that this useful trick only works at the REPL. The underscore doesn't have any special behavior in Python scripts or programs. Notice that not all statements have a return value. When we assigned five to x, there was no return value, only the side effect of bringing the variable x into being. Other statements have more visible side effects. Try print('Hello, Python') at the prompt. You'll need parentheses after the print and quotes around the text. Then, press Enter. You'll see that Python immediately evaluates and executes this command printing the string Hello, Python and returning you to another prompt. It's important to understand that the response here is not the result of the expression evaluated and displayed by the REPL, but is a side effect of the print function. As an aside, print is one of the most visible differences between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 3, the parentheses are required, whereas in Python 2, they were not. This is because in Python 3, print is a function call. More on functions later. At this point, we should show you how to exit the REPL and get back to your system shell prompt. We do this by sending the end of file control character to Python. Although, unfortunately, the means of sending this character varies across platforms. If you're on Windows, press Ctrl+Z followed by Enter to exit. If you're on Mac or Linux, press Ctrl+D to exit. If you regularly switch between platforms and you accidentally press Ctrl+Z on a Unix-like system, you will inadvertently suspend the Python interpretor and return to your operating system shell. To reactivate Python by making it a foreground process again, simply run the fg command and press Enter a couple of times to get the triple arrow Python prompt back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Significant Whitespace in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Start your Python 3 interpretor using the Python or Python 3 command for Windows or Unix-like systems, respectively. The control flow structures of Python, such as for-loops, while loops, and if-statements are all introduced by statements, which are terminated by a colon, indicating that the body of the construct is to follow. For example, for-loops require a body, so if you enter for i in range(5) terminated by a colon, Python will change the prompt to three dots to request that you provide the body. One distinctive and sometimes controversial aspect of Python is that leading whitespace is syntactically significant. What this means is that Python uses indentation levels rather than the braces used by other languages to demarcate code blocks. By convention, contemporary Python code is indented by four spaces for each level. So, we provide those four spaces and a statement to form the body of the loop, x equals i times 10. Our loop body will contain a second statement. So, after pressing Return, at the next three dot prompt, we enter another four spaces, followed by a call to the built-in print function, print(x). To terminate our for-loop block, we must enter a blank line into the REPL at the three dots. With the block complete, Python executes the pending code. Printing out the multiples of 10, less than 50. Looking at a screen full of Python code, we can see how the indentation clearly matches and in fact, must match the structure of the program. Even if we replace the code by gray lines, the structure of the program is clear. Each statement, terminated by a colon, starts a new line and introduces an additional level of indentation, which continues until a dedent restores the indentation to a previous level. Each level of indent is typically four spaces, although, we'll cover the rules in more detail in a moment. Python's approach to significant whitespace has three great advantages. First, it forces developers to use a single level of indentation in a code block. This is generally considered good practice in any language because it makes code much more readable. Second, code with significant whitespace doesn't need to be cluttered with unnecessary braces and you never need to have code standard debates about where the braces should go. All code blocks in Python code are easily identifiable and everyone writes them the same way. Third, significant whitespace requires that a consistent interpretation must be given to the structure of the code by the author, the Python runtime system, and future maintainers who need to read the code. So, you can never have code that contains a block from Python's point of view but which doesn't look like it from a cursory human perspective. The rules for Python indentation can seem complex, but they are straight-forward in practice. The whitespace you use can be either spaces or tabs. The general consensus is that spaces are preferable to tabs and four spaces has become a standard in the Python community. One essential rule is never to mix spaces and tabs. The Python interpretor will complain and your colleagues will hunt you down. You are allowed to use different amounts of indentation at different times, if you wish. The essential rule is that consecutive lines of code at the same indentation level are considered to be part of the same block. There are some exceptions to these rules, but they almost always have to do with improving code readability in other ways. For example, by breaking up necessarily long statements over multiple lines. This rigorous approach to code formatting is programming as Guido indented it. The philosophy of placing a high value on code qualities, such as readability, gets to the very heart of Python culture. Something we'll take a short break to explore now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python Culture and the Zen of Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Many programming languages are at the center of a cultural movement. They have their own communities, values, practices, and philosophy. And Python is no exception. The development of the Python language itself is managed through a series of documents called Python Enhancement Proposals or PEPs. One of the PEPs, called PEP 8, explains how you should format your code and we follow its guidelines throughout this course. It is PEP 8 which recommends we use four spaces for indentation in new Python code. Another of these PEPs, called PEP 20, is The Zen of Python. It refers to 20 aphorisms describing the guiding principles of Python, only 19 of which have been written down. Conveniently, The Zen of Python is never further away than the nearest Python interpretor, as it can always be accessed from the REPL by typing import this. Throughout this course, we'll be highlighting particular nuggets of wisdom from The Zen of Python in Moments of Zen, to understand how they apply to what we have learned. As we've just introduced Python's significant indentation, this is a good time for our first Moment of Zen. (tranquil music) Readability counts. Clarity matters, so readability makes for valuable code. In time, you'll come to appreciate Python's significant whitespace for the elegance it brings to your code and the ease with which you can read others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importing From the Python Standard Library\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, Python comes with an extensive standard library. An aspect of Python often referred to as batteries included. The standard library is structured as modules, a topic we'll discuss in-depth later in the course. What's important at this stage is to know that you gain access to standard library modules by using the import keyword. The basic form of importing a module is simply the import keyword, followed by a space and the name of the module. For example, let's see how we can use the standard library's math module to compute square roots. At the triple arrow prompt, we type import math. Since import is a statement which doesn't return a value, Python doesn't print anything if the import succeeds and we're immediately returned to the prompt. We can access the contents of the imported module by using the name of the module, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the attribute in the module that you need. Like many object-oriented languages, the dot operator is used to drill down into object structures. Being expert Pythonistas, we have inside knowledge that the math module contains a function called square root. Let's try to use it. We do math.sqrt(81), which, of course, gives us nine. But how can we find out what other functions are available in the math module? The REPL has a special function help, which can retrieve any embedded documentation from objects for which it has been provided, such as standard library modules. To get help, type, simply, help. We'll leave you to explore the first form for interactive help in your own time. We'll go for the second option and pass the math module as the object for which we want help. You can use the space bar to page down through the help, and if you're on Mac or Linux, use the arrow keys to scroll up and down. Browsing through the functions, we can see there's a math function for computing factorials. Press Q to exit the help browser and return us to the Python REPL. Practice using help to request specific help on the factorial function. And press Q again to return to the REPL. Let's use the factorial function with math.factorial(5), which is 120. Or math.factorial(6), which is 720. Notice that the function accepts and returns an integer. See also how we need to qualify the function name with the module namespace. This is generally good practice, as it makes it abundantly clear where the function is coming from. That said, it can result in code that is excessively verbose. Let's use factorials to compute how many ways there are to draw three fruit from a set of five fruit using some math we learned in school. We have n equals five, k equals three, the factorial of n over the factorial of k, multiplied by the factorial of n minus k, which gives 10. This simple expression is quite verbose, with all those references to the math module. The Python import statement has an alternative form that allows us to bring a specific function from a module into the current namespace. From math import factorial. This is a good improvement, but it's still a little long-winded for such a simple expression. A third form of the import statement allows us to rename the imported function. This can be useful for reasons of readability or to avoid a namespace clash. Useful as it is, we recommend that this feature be only used infrequently and judiciously. Remember that when we used factorial alone, it returned an integer. But our more complex expression for combinations is returning a floating-point number. This is because we've used Python's floating-point division operator, the single forward slash. We can improve our expression, since we know it will only ever return integral results, by using Python's integer division operator, which is the double forward slash. What's notable is that many other programming languages would fail on the above expression for even moderate values of n. In most programming languages, the regular, garden-variety signed integers can only store values less than two to the power of 31. However, factorials grow so fast that the largest factorial you can fit into a 32-bit signed integer is 12 factorial, since 13 factorial is too large. In most widely used programming languages, you would need more complex code or more sophisticated mathematics, merely to compute how many ways there are to draw three fruits from a set of 13 fruits. Python encounters no such problems and can compute with arbitrarily large integers, limited only by the memory in your computer. Let's try the larger problem of computing how many different pairs of fruit we can pick from 100 different fruits, assuming we can lay our hands on so many fruit. We n equal to 100 and k equal to two, the result is 4,950. Just to emphasis how large the size of the first term of that expression is, calculate 100 factorial on its own. Wow, that's a number vastly larger even than the number of atoms in the known universe, with an awful lot of digits. If, like me, you're curious to know exactly how many digits, we can convert our integer to a text string and count the number of characters in the string, like this. That's our cue to move on and look at integers, strings, and other built-in types, in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalar Types: int, float, None and bool\n",
      "\n",
      "Python comes with a number of built-in data types. These include primitive scalar types, like integers as well as collection types, like dictionaries. These built-in types are powerful enough to be used alone for many programming needs. And they can be used as building blocks for creating more complex data types. In this section, we'll cover the following basic scalars, int for whole numbers, float for numbers with fractional parts, None, an important placeholder value, and bool, used for True and False values. We'll provide basic information about these now, showing their literal forms and how to create them. We've already seen quite a lot of Python integers in action. Python integers are signed and have, for all practical purposes, unlimited precision. Integer literals in Python are specified in decimal and may also be specified in binary with a zero b prefix, or octal with a zero o prefix, or hexadecimal with a zero x prefix. We can also construct integers by a call to the int constructor, which can convert from other numeric types, such as floats to integers. Here is int(3.5), which gives three. Note that the rounding is always towards zero. So, int(-3.5) gives minus 3. We can also convert strings to integers. Here's a string containing the digits four, nine, six, being converted to 496. And we can even supply an optional number base when converting from a string. Here we convert one zero zero zero, in base three, to 81 decimal. Floating-point numbers are supported in Python by the float type. Python floats are implemented as IEE-754 double precision floating-point numbers with 53 bits of binary precision. This is equivalent to between 15 and 16 significant digits in decimal. Any literal number containing a decimal point or a letter e is interpreted by Python as a float, here is 3.125. Scientific notation can also be used. So, for large numbers, such as the approximate speed of light in meters per second, three times 10 to the eight, we can write 3e8. And for small numbers, like Planck's constant 1.616 times 10 to the minus 35, we can enter 1.616e minus 35. Notice how Python automatically switches the display representation to the most readable form. As for integers, we can convert to floats from other numeric or string types using the float constructor. Here's a float constructed from the integer seven and from a string containing 1.618. This is also how we create the special floating-point values nan or not a number, and also positive and negative infinity. Be aware that the result of any calculation involving both int and float is promoted to a float. You can read more about Python's number types in the Python documentation. Python has a special nul value called None, with a capital N. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value. The Python REPL never prints None results, so typing None into the REPL has no effect. None can be bound to variable names, just like any other object. And we can test whether an object is None by using Python's is operator. We can see here that the response is True, which brings us, conveniently, onto the bool type. The bool type represents logical states and plays an important role in several of Python's control flow structures, as we'll see shortly. As you would expect, there are two bool values, True and False, both with initial capitals. There's also a bool constructor which can be used to convert from other types to bool. Let's look at how it works. For integers, zero is considered falsey and all other values are truthy. So, bool(0) is False, bool(42) is True, and bool(-1) is also True. We see the same behavior with floats where only zero is considered falsey. So, bool(0.0) is False, bool(0.207) is True, and bool(-1.117) is True. When converting from collections, such as strings or lists, only empty collections are treated as falsey. We'll be looking at lists in a lot more detail shortly. Converting an empty list, shown here by the square brackets to bool is False, whereas converting a list containing the integers one, five, and nine to bool is True because the list is not empty. Similar rules apply to strings. Only the empty string is False. Any other string, such as spam here, is True. In particular, you cannot use the bool constructor to convert from string representations of True and False. Converting False as a string to bool, gives True because the string False is not empty. These conversions to bool are important because they are widely used in Python if-statements and while loops, which accept bool values into the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relational Operators\n",
      "\n",
      "Bool values are commonly produced by Python's relational operators, which can be used for comparing objects. These include value equality or equivalence, value inequality or inequivalence, less-than, greater-than, less-than or equal to, and greater-than or equal to. Two of the most widely used are Python's equality and inequality tests, which actually test for equivalence or inequivalence of values. That is, two objects are equivalent if one could be used in place of the other. We'll learn more about the notion of object equivalence later in the course. For now, we'll compare simple integers. Let's start by assigning or binding a value to a variable g by writing g equals 20. We test for equality with the double equals operator, g is equal to 20 is True and g is equal to 13, which is False. Or we can test for inequality using the not equals operator, g is not equal to 20 is False and g is not equal to 13 is True. We can also compare the order of quantities using the rich comparison operators, g is less-than 30 is True, g is greater-than 30, which is False, g is less-than or equal to 20, which is True, and g is greater-than equal to 20, which is also True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditional Statements\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we've examined some basic built-in types, we'll look at two important control flow structures which depend on the conversions to the bool type, if-statements and while loops. We'll start with if-statements, also known as conditional statements. Conditional statements allow us to branch execution based on the value of an expression. The form of the statement is the if keyword, followed by an expression, terminated by a colon, to introduce a new block. Let's try this at the REPL. If True colon, remembering to indent four spaces within the block, we add some code to be executed if the condition is true, print(\"It's true!\"). We'll follow this with a blank line to terminate the if block at which point, the block will execute because, self-evidently, the condition is true. Conversely, if the condition is false, the code in the block does not execute. If false, print(\"It's true!\") produces no output. The expression used with the if-statements will be converted to a bool, just as if the bool constructor had been used. So, if bool(\"eggs\"): print(\"Yes please!\") is exactly equivalent to if \"eggs\": print(\"Yes please!\"). Thanks to this useful shorthand, explicit conversion to bool using the bool constructor is rarely seen in Python. The if-statement supports an optional else clause, which goes in a block introduced by the else keyword, followed by a colon, which is indented to the same level as the if keyword. Let's assign 42 to a new variable, h. Then, do if h is greater-than 50: print(\"Greater than 50\"). To start the else block in this case, we just omit the indentation after the three dots. Else colon and then, in the else block, we must indent by four spaces again, print(\"50 or smaller\"). After entering a blank line to complete the structure, the code executes, printing 50 or smaller, showing that our else block executed. For multiple conditions, you might be tempted to do something like this. Nesting if-else structures within other if-else structures. Whenever you find yourself with an else block containing a nested if-statement like this, you should consider using Python's elif keyword, which is a combined else-if. As The Zen of Python reminds us, flat is better than nested. This version is all together easier to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "Python has two types of loop, for-loops and while loops. We've already briefly encountered for-loops back when we introduced significant whitespace and we'll return to them soon, but right now, we'll cover while loops. While loops in Python are introduced by the while keyword, which is followed by a Boolean expression. As with the condition in if-statements, the expression is implicitly converted to a Boolean value, as if it had been passed to the bool constructor. The while statement is terminated by a colon because it introduces a new block. Let's write a while loop at the REPL, which counts down from five to one. We'll initialize a counter variable called c to five and keep looping until we reach zero. Another new language feature we're introducing here is the use of the augmented assignment operator to subtract one from the value of the counter on each iteration. Similar augmented assignment operators exist for the other basic math operators, such as plus and multiply. Because the condition or predicate will be implicitly converted to bool, just as if a call to the bool constructor were present, we could replace the above code with the following version where we just use while c. This works because the conversion of the integer value of c to bool results in True until we get to zero, which converts to False. That said, to use the short form in this case, might be described as unpythonic because, referring back to The Zen of Python, explicit is better than implicit and we place higher value on the readability of the first form, over the concision of the second form. While loops are often used in Python where an infinite loop is required. We achieve this simply by passing True as the predicate expression to the while construct. While True: print(\"Looping!\"). Now you're probably wondering how we get out of this loop again and regain control of our REPL. We press Ctrl+C, which Python intercepts to raise a special exception which terminates the loop. We'll be talking much more about what exceptions are and how to use them later in this course. Many programming languages supports a loop construct which places the predicate test at the end of the loop, rather than at the beginning. For example, C, C++, C Sharp, and Java support the do while construct. Other languages have repeat until loops instead or as well. This is not the case in Python where the idiom is to use while True together with an early exit facilitated by the break statement. The break statement jumps out of the loop and only the innermost loop, if several loops have been nested, continuing execution immediately after the loop body. Let's look at an example of break introducing a few other Python features along the way. We start with a while True for an infinite loop. On the first statement within the while block, we use the built-in input function to request a string from the user. We'll assign that string to a variable called response. We'll now use an if-statement to test whether the value provided is divisible by seven. We convert the response string to an integer using the int constructor and then use the modulus operator, with the percent symbol, to divide by seven and give the remainder. If the remainder is equal to zero, the response was divisible by seven, and we enter the body of the if block. Within the if block, now two levels of indentation deep, we start with eight spaces and used the break keyword. Break terminates the innermost loop, in this case the while loop, and causes execution to jump to the first statement after the loop or in our case, the end of the program. Enter a blank line at the three dots prompt to close both the if block and the while block. Our loop will start executing and we'll pause at the call to the input function waiting for us to enter a number. Let's try a few. 12, 67, 34, 28, as soon as we enter a number divisible by seven, the predicate becomes True, we enter the if block and then, literally break out of the loop to end the program, returning us to the REPL prompt.\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "We've covered a lot of ground in this Getting Started module. Let's summarize what we've seen. We started by ensuring that Python 3 is available on Windows, Ubuntu Linux, and Mac OS. We then looked at the Read-Eval-Print-Loop or REPL and how it allows us to interactively explore Python code. We learned some simple arithmetic operators with plus, minus, multiply, divide, modulus, and the integer division operator with double slash. We discovered we could give objects names with the assignment operator, using the equal symbol. We learned how to print objects using the built-in print function. And we showed you how to exit the REPL, which is different between Windows, which uses Ctrl+Z and Linux or Mac, which uses Ctrl+D. We showed how Python uses significant indentation to demarcate code blocks. Each indent level is preferably four spaces. And we told you about Python Enhancement Proposals, the documents which govern the evolution of the Python language. In particular, we briefly looked at PEP 8, which is the Python Style Guide, which we follow in this course, and PEP 20, The Zen of Python, which gives useful advice on writing Pythonic code. We looked at importing Python standard library modules using the import statement in its three different forms. We showed how to find and browse help, particularly useful for discovering the standard library. We looked at the four built-in scalar types int, float, None, and bool and conversions between these types and how to use their literal forms. We looked at the six relational operators used for equivalence and ordering. We demonstrated structuring conditional code with if, elif, else structures. We showed iterating with while loops, with the important implicit conversion to bool, of the predicate expression. And how to interrupt infinite loops with Ctrl+C, which generates a KeyboardInterrupt exception. We gave an example of how to break out of a loop using the break statement, which breaks out of the innermost loop and jumps to the first statement immediately following the loop. And along the way, we looked at augmented assignment operators for modifying objects, such as counter variables in-place. We also looked at requesting text from the user with the built-in input function. Next time here on Python Fundamentals, we'll continue our exploration of Python's built-in types and control flow structures by looking at strings, lists, dictionaries, and for-loops. We'll even be using Python to fetch some data from the web for processing. Thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next module.\n",

      "Hi. My name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the second module of the Python Fundamentals course, which is about strings, collections, and iteration with for-loops. Python includes a rich selection of collection types, which are often completely sufficient for even quite intricate programs without resorting to defining our own data structures. We'll give enough of an overview of some fundamental collection types now, enough to allow us to write some interesting code. We'll also be revisiting each of these collection types together with a few additional ones later in the course. Let's start with these types str, bytes, list, and dict. Along the way we'll also cover Python's for-loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings in Python have the data type str spelled S-T-R, and we've been using them extensively already. Strings are sequences of Unicode codepoints, and for the most part you can think of codepoints as being like characters, although they aren't strictly equivalent. The sequence of characters in a Python string is immutable meaning that once you've constructed a string you can't modify its contents. Literal strings in Python are delimited by quotes. You can use single quotes or double quotes. You must, however, be consistent. For example, you can't do this. Supporting both quoting styles allows you to easily incorporate the other quote characters into the literal string without resorting to ugly escape character gymnastics. Notice that the REPL exploits the same quoting flexibility when echoing the strings back to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moment of Zen: Practicality Beats Purity\n",
      "\n",
      "At first sight, support for both quoting styles seems to violate an important principle of Pythonic style from The Zen of Python. There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it. In this case, however, another aphorism from the same source, practicality beats purity, takes precedence. The utility of supporting two quoting styles is valued more highly than the alternative, a single quoting style combined with more frequent use of ugly escape sequences, which we'll encounter shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings (Continued)\n",
      "\n",
      "Adjacent literal strings are concatenated by the Python compiler into a single string, which although at first it seems rather pointless, can be useful for nicely formatting code as we'll see later. If you want a literal string containing new lines, you have two options, use multiline strings or use escape sequences. First, multiline strings. Multiline strings are delimited by three quote characters rather than one. Here's an example of using three double quotes. Notice how when the string is echoed back to us the new lines are represented by the slash N escapes sequence. We can also use three single quotes. As an alternative to using multiline quoting, we can just embed the control characters ourselves, or to get a better sense of what we're representing, we can use print to see the string. If you're working on Windows, you might be thinking that new lines should be represented by the carriage return at new line couplet \\r\\n. There's no need to do that with Python since Python 3 has a feature called universal newlines support, which translates from the simple \\n to the native newline sequence for your platform on input and output. You can read more about universal newlines support in PEP278. We can use the escapes sequences for other purposes too such as incorporating tabs with slash T or allowing us to use quote characters within strings by using a slash followed by the quote sign that you want. See how Python is smarter than we are using the most convenient quote delimiters, although Python will also resort to escapes sequences when we use both types of quotes in a string. Because the backslash has special meaning, to place a backslash in a string we escape the backslash with itself. To reassure ourselves that there really is only one backslash in that string, we can print it. You can read more about escape sequences in the Python documentation at python.org. Sometimes, particularly when dealing with strings such as Windows file system paths or regular expression patterns, which use backslashes extensively, the requirement to double up on backslashes can be ugly and error prone. Python comes to the rescue with its raw strings. Raw strings don't support any escapes sequences and are very much what you see is what you get. To create a raw string, prefix the opening quote with a lowercase R. We can use the string constructor to create string representations of other types such as integers or floats. Strings in Python are what are called sequence types, which means they support certain common operations for querying sequences. For example, we can access individual characters using square brackets with an integer zero-based index. Note that in contrast to many other programming languages there is no separate character type distinct from the string type. The indexing operation we just used returns a full-blown string that contains a single character element, something we can test using Python's built-in type function. There will be more on types and classes later in the course. String objects also support a wide variety of operations implemented as methods. We can list those methods by using help on the string type. Ignore all the hieroglyphics with underscores for now, and page down until you see the documentation for the capitalize method. Press Q to quit the help browser, and we'll try to use that method. First, let's make a string that deserves capitalization, the proper noun of a capital city no less. To call methods on objects in Python, we use the dot after the object name and before the method name. Methods are functions, so we must use the parentheses to indicate that the method should be called. Remember that strings are immutable, so the capitalize method didn't modify C in place. It returned a new string. We can verify this by displaying C, which remains unchanged. You might like to spend a little time familiarizing yourself with the various useful methods provided by the string  Finally, because strings are fully Unicode capable, you can use them with international characters easily, even in literals because the default source code encoding for Python 3 is UTF-8. For example, if you have access to Norwegian characters, you can simply enter this. Alternatively, you can use the hexadecimal Unicode codepoints as an escape sequence prefixed by slash U, which I'm sure you'll agree is somewhat more unwieldy. There are no such Unicode capabilities in the otherwise similar bytes type, which we'll look at next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bytes\n",
      "\n",
      "Bytes are very similar to strings except that rather than being sequences of Unicode codepoints, they are sequences of well, bytes. As such, they are used for raw binary data and fixed with single byte character encodings such as ASCII. As with strings, they have a simple literal form using quotes, the first of which is prefixed by a lowercase B. There is also a bytes constructor, but it's an advanced feature, and we won't cover it in this fundamentals course. At this point, it's sufficient for us to recognize bytes literals and understand that they support most of the same operations as strings such as indexing and splitting. You'll see that the split method returns a list of bytes objects. To convert between bytes and strings, we must know the encoding of the byte sequence used to represent the string's Unicode codepoints as bytes. Python supports a wide variety of encodings, a full list of which can be found at python.org. Let's start with an interesting Unicode string, which contains all the characters of the 29 letter Norwegian alphabet, a pangram. We'll now encode that using UTF-8 into a bytes object. See how the Norwegian characters have each been rendered as pairs of bytes. We can reverse the process using the decode method of the bytes object. Again, we must supply the correct encoding. We can check that the result is equal to what we started with and display it for good measure. This may seem like an unnecessary detail so early in the course, especially if you operate in an anglophone environment, but it's crucial to understand since files and network resources such as HTTP responses are transmitted as byte streams whereas we prefer to work with the convenience of Unicode strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lists\n",
      "\n",
      "Python lists such as those returned by the string's split method are sequences of objects. Unlike strings, lists are mutable in so far as the elements within them can be replaced or removed, and new elements can be inserted or appended. Lists are the workhorse of Python data structures. Literal lists are delimited by square brackets, and the items within the list separated by commas. Here is a list of three numbers and a list of three strings. We can retrieve elements by using square brackets with a zero-based index, and we can replace elements by assigning to a specific element. See how lists can be heterogeneous with respect to the types of the objects. We now have a list containing a string, an integer, and another string. It's often useful to create an empty list, which we can do using empty square brackets. We can modify the list in other ways. Let's add some floats to the end of the list using the append method. There are many other useful methods for manipulating lists, which we'll cover in a later module. There is also a list constructor, which can be used to create lists from other collections such as strings. Finally, although the significant whitespace rules in Python can at first seem very rigid, there is a lot of flexibility. For example, if at the end of the line brackets, braces, or parentheses are unclosed, you can continue on the next line. This can be very useful for long literal collections or simply to improve readability. See also how we're allowed to use an additional comma after the last element, an important maintainability feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionaries\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionaries are completely fundamental to the way the Python language works and are very widely used. A dictionary maps keys to values and in some languages is known as an associate of array. Let's look at how to create and use them in Python. Literal dictionaries are created using curly braces containing key value pairs. Each pair is separated by a comma, and each key is separated from the corresponding value by a colon. Here we use a dictionary to create a simple telephone directory. We can retrieve items by key using the square brackets operator and update the values associated with the key by assigning through the square brackets. If we assign to a key that has not yet been added, a new entry is created. Be aware that the entries in the dictionary can't be relied upon to be stored in any particular order. Similarly to lists, empty dictionaries can be created using empty curly braces. We'll revisit dictionaries in much more detail in Module 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "For-Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have the tools to make some interesting data structures, we'll look at Python's second type of loop construct, the for-loop. For-loops in Python correspond to what are called for-each loops in many other programming languages. They request items one-by-one from a collection or more strictly from an iterable series, but more of that later, and assign them in turn to a variable we specify. Let's create a collection and use a for-loop to iterate over it. If you iterate over dictionaries, you get the keys, which you can then use within the for-loop body to retrieve values. Here we define a dictionary mapping string color names to hexadecimal integer color codes. Note that we use the ability of the built-in print function to accept multiple arguments. We pass the key and the value for each color separately. See also how the color codes returned to us are in decimal. Now, before we put some of what we've learned together into a useful program, practice exiting the Python REPL with Control+Z on Windows or Control+D on Mac or Linux.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it All Together\n",
      "\n",
      "In this last section before we summarize, we're going to write a longer snippet at the REPL and briefly introduce the with-statement. We're going to fetch some text data for some classic literature from the web using a Python Standard Library function called the urlopen. To get access to urlopen, we need to import the function from the request module within the standard library urllib package. Next we're going to call urlopen with a URL to our story. We'll be using a Python construct called a with block to manage the resource returned by the URL since under the hood fetching the resource from the web requires operating system sockets and such like. We'll be talking more about with-statements in a later module, but for now it's enough to know that using a with-statement with objects which use external resources such as this is very good practice to avoid resource leaks. The with-statement calls the urlopen function and binds the response to a variable named story. Notice that the with-statement is terminated by a colon introducing a new block, so we indent four spaces and create an empty list, which ultimately will hold all of the words from the text. Next we open a for-loop, which will work through the story. Recall that for-loops request items one-by- one from the term on the right of the in keyword, in this case story, and assign them in turn to the name on the left, in this case line. It so happens that the type of HTTP response represented by story yields successive lines of text when iterated over in this way. So, the for-loop retrieves one line of text at a time from Dickens' classic. Note also that the for-statement is terminated by a colon because it introduces the body of the for-loop, which is a new block and hence a further level of indentation. For each line of text we use the split method to divide it into words on whitespace boundaries resulting in a list of words we call line words. Now we use a second for-loop nested inside the first to iterate over this list of words appending each in turn to the accumulating story_words list. Finally, we enter a blank line at the three dots prompt to close all open blocks. In this case, the inner for-loop, the outer for-loop, and the with-block will all be terminated. The block will be executed, and after a short delay Python now returns us to the regular triple arrow prompt. At this point, if Python gives you an error such as a syntax error or indentation error, you should go back, review what you have entered, and carefully reenter the code until Python accepts the whole block without complaint. If you get an HTTP error, then you were unable to fetch the resource over the internet, and you should try again later, although it's worth checking that you have typed the URL correctly. We can now look at those words simply by asking Python to evaluate the value of story_words. Here we can see the list of words. Notice that each of the single quoted words is prefixed by a lowercase B meaning that we have a list of bytes objects where we would have preferred a list of strings. This is because the HTTP request transferred raw bytes to us over the network. To get a list of strings, we should decode the byte stream in each line into UTF-8 Unicode strings. We can do this by inserting a call to the decode method of the bytes object and then operating on the resulting Unicode string. The Python REPL supports a simple command line history, and by careful use of the up and down arrows we can reenter our snippet. When we get to the line which needs to be changed, we can edit it using the left and right arrow keys to insert the requisite call to decode. Then when we rerun the block and take a fresh look at story_words we should see we have a list of strings. We've just about reached the limit of what's possible to comfortably edit at the Python REPL, so in the next course module we'll look at how to move this code into a Python module where it can be more easily worked within a text editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's sum up. First, we looked at strings, in particular the various forms of quoting for single- and multi- line strings. We saw how adjacent string literals are implicitly concatenated. Python has support for universal newlines, so no matter what platform you're using, it's sufficient to use a single slash N character safe in the knowledge that it will be appropriately translated to and from the native newline during I/O. Escape sequences provide an alternative means of incorporating newlines and other control characters into literal strings. The backslashes used for escaping can be a hindrance for Windows file system paths or regular expressions, so raw strings with an R prefix can be used to suppress the escaping mechanism. Other types such as integers can be converted to strings using the str() constructor. Individual characters returned as one character strings can be retrieved using square brackets with integer zero-based indices. Strings support a rich variety of operations such as splitting through their methods. In Python 3 literal strings can contain Unicode characters directly in the source. The bytes type has many of the capabilities of strings, but is a sequence of bytes rather than a sequence of Unicode codepoints. Bytes literals are prefixed with a lowercase B. To covert between string and bytes instances, we use the encode() method of str and the decode() method of bytes in both cases passing the encoding, which we must know in advance. Lists are mutable, heterogeneous sequences of objects. List literals are delimited by square brackets, and the items are separated by commas. As with strings, individual elements can be retrieved by indexing into a list with square brackets. In contrast to strings, individual list elements can be replaced by assigning to the indexed item. Lists can be grown by appending to them and can be constructed from other sequences using the list() constructor. Dictionaries associate keys with values. Literal dictionaries are delimited by curly braces. The key value pairs are separated from each other by commas, and each key is associated with its corresponding value with a colon. For-loops take items one-by-one from an iterable object such as a list and bind the name to the current item. For-loops correspond to what are called for-each loops in other languages.

      "\n",
      "Hello. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the third module of the Python Fundamentals course, which is about the structure and organization, or modularity, of Python programs. Modularity is an important property for anything but trivial software systems as it gives us the power to make self-contained, reusable pieces, which can be combined in new ways to solve different problems. As with most programming languages, the most fine-grained modularization facility is the definition of reusable functions. Collections of related functions are typically grouped into source code files called modules. Modules can be used from other modules, so long as we take care not to introduce a circular dependency. As we have seen already, we can import modules into the REPL, and we'll show you how modules can be executed directly as programs or scripts. Along the way, we'll investigate the Python execution model to ensure you have a good understanding of exactly when code is evaluated and executed. We'll round off by showing you how to use command line arguments to get basic configuration data into your program and make your program executable. To illustrate this module, we'll be taking the code snippet for retrieving words from a web-hosted text document we developed at the end of the previous session and organizing it into a fully-fledged Python module.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating, Running, and Importing a Module\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the snippet we worked with last time. Open a text editor, preferably one with syntax highlighting support for Python, and configure it to insert four spaces per indent level when you press the tab key. You should also check that your editor saves the file using the UTF-8 encoding as that's what the Python 3 runtime expects by default. Let's get the snippet we wrote at the REPL at the end of the previous module into a text file called words.py. All Python source files use the .py extension. Now we're using a text file for our code, we can pay a little more attention to readability. Let's put a blank line after the import statement. Save the file in a directory called pyfund in your home directory. Switch to a console with your operating system shell prompt and change to the new pyfund directory. We can execute our module simply by calling python3 and passing the module's filename. When you press return, after a short delay, you'll be returned to the system prompt. Not very impressive, but if you got no response, the program is running as expected. If, on the other hand, you got an error, an HTTP error indicates there's a network problem while other types of error probably mean you mistyped the code. Let's add another for loop to the end of the program to print out one word per line. This is much better. Now we have the beginnings of a useful program. Our module can also be imported into the REPL. Let's try that and see what happens. Start the REPL and import your module. When importing, we omit the file extension. The code in your module is executed immediately when imported, maybe not what you'd expected and not very useful. To give us more control over when our code is executed and to allow it to be reused, we'll need to put our code in a function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining Functions and Returning Values\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's quickly define a few functions at the REPL to get the idea. Functions are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name, an argument list in parentheses, and a colon to start a new block. We use the return keyword to return a value form the function. As we've seen previously, we call functions by providing the actual arguments in parentheses, if there are any, after the function name. Functions aren't required to explicitly return a value though. Perhaps they produce side effects. You can return early from a function by using the return keyword with no parameter. A return keyword without a parameter, or the implicit return at the end of a function, actually causes the function to return None, although remember that the REPL doesn't display None results, so we don't see them. By capturing the returned object into a named variable, we can test for None.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distinguishing Between Module Import and Module Execution\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's organize our words module using functions. We'll move all the code, except the import statement, into a function called fetch_words. You do that simply by adding the def statement and indenting the code below it by one extra level. Save the module and reload the module using a fresh Python REPL. The module imports, but the words are not fetched until we call the fetch_words function. Alternatively, we can import our specific function. So far, so good. But what happens when we try to run our module directly from the operating system shell? Exit the REPL with Control +D on Mac or Linux or Control +Z on Windows, and run python3 passing the module filename words.py. No words are printed. This is because all executing the module does now is define a function and then immediately exit. To make a module from which we can usefully import functions into the REPL, and which can be run as a script, we need to learn a new Python idiom. The Python runtime system defines some special variables and attributes, the names of which are delimited by double underscores. One such variable is called __name__ and gives us the means for our module to detect whether it has been run as a script or imported into another module or the REPL. To see how, add print__name__ at the end of your module, outside the fetch_words function. First of all, let's import the modified words module back into the REPL with import words. We can see that when imported, double underscore name does indeed evaluate to the module's name. As a brief aside, if we import the module again, the print statement will not be executed. Module code is only executed once on first import. Now, let's try running the module as a script with python3 words.py. Now the special name variable is equal to the string __main__, which is also delimited by double underscores. Our module can use this behavior to detect how it is being used. We replaced the print statement with an if statement, which tests the value of double underscore name (__name__), and if it is equal to double underscore main (__main__), executes our function. Now we can safely import our module without unduly executing our function. And we can usefully run our function as a script.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python Execution Model\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to understand the Python execution model and precisely when function definitions and other important events occur when a module is imported or executed. Here we show execution of our Python module in the PyCharm graphical debugging environment. We step through the top-level statements in the module. What's important to realize here is that the def used for the fetch_words function isn't really a declaration. It's actually a statement, which when used in sequence with the other top-level module scope code causes the code within the function to be bound to the name of the function. When modules are imported or run, all of the top-level statements are run, and this is the means by which functions within the module namespace are defined. We're sometimes asked about the differences between Python modules, Python scripts, and Python programs. Any py file constitutes a Python module. But as we've seen, modules can be written for convenient import, convenient execution, or using the if __name__ equals __main__ idiom, both. We strongly recommend making even simple scripts importable since it eases development and testing so much if you can access your code from the Python REPL. Likewise, even modules which are only ever meant to be imported in production settings benefit from having executable test code. For this reason, nearly all modules we create have this form of defining one or more importable functions with a postscript to facilitate execution. Whether you consider our module to be a Python script or a Python program is a matter of context and usage. It's certainly wrong to consider Python to be merely a scripting tool in the vein of Windows batch files or Unix shell scripts as many large and complex applications have been built exclusively with Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Functions and Command Line Arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we'll look at setting up a main function with a command line argument. We'll start by refining our word fetching module a little further. First, we'll perform a small refactoring and separate the word retrieval and collection on the one hand from the word printing on the other. This is because when importing, we'd rather get the words as a list, but when running directly, we'd prefer the words to be printed. Next, we'll extract a function from our if __name__ equals __main__ block called main. By moving this code into a function, we can test it from the REPL, which isn't possible while it's in the module scope if block. We can now try these functions from the REPL. We'll use this opportunity to introduce a couple of new forms of the import statement. The first new form imports multiple objects from a module using a comma-separated list. The parentheses are optional, but they do allow you to break this list over multiple lines if it gets long. This form is perhaps the most widely used form of the import statement. The second new form imports everything from a module using an asterisk wildcard. This latter form is recommended only for casual use at the REPL. It can wreak havoc in programs since what is imported is now potentially beyond your control, opening yourself up to namespace clashes at some future time. Having done this, we can fetch words from the URL, print any list of words, or indeed run the main program. Notice that the print words function isn't fussy about the type of items in the list. It's perfectly happy to print a list of numbers. So, perhaps print_words isn't the best name. In fact, the function doesn't mention lists either. It will happily print any collection that the for loop is capable of iterating over, such as a string. Given this, we'll perform a minor refactoring and rename this function to print_items, changing the variable names within the function to suit. We'll talk more about the dynamic typing in Python, which allows this degree of flexibility, in the next module. One obvious improvement to our module would be to replace the hard-coded URL with a value we can pass in. Let's extract that value into an argument of the fetch_words function called URL. When running our module as a standalone program, we need to accept the URL as a command line argument. Access to command line arguments in Python is through an attribute of the sys module called argv, which is a list of strings. To use it, we must import sys at the top of our program and then get the second argument with an index of 1 from the list. This works as expected when we pass a URL from the command line. This all looks fine until we realize that we can't usefully test the main function any longer from the REPL because it refers to sys.argv The solution is to allow the argument list to be passed as a formal argument to the main function using sys.argv as the actual parameter in the if __name__ == __main__ block. Testing from the REPL again, we show that main is also usable from here. For more sophisticated command line processing, we recommend you look at the Python standard library argparse module or the inspired third-party docopt module.\n",

      "Sparse Is Better Than Dense\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have noticed that our top-level functions have two blank lines between them. This is conventional for modern Python code. Sparse is better than dense. Two between functions, that is the number of lines PEP 8 recommends. According to the PEP 8 style guide, it's customary to use two blank lines between module level functions. We find this convention has served us well making code easier to navigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Documenting Your Code Using Docstrings\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we'll look at documenting your code using a feature called docstrings. We saw previously how it was possible to ask at the REPL for help on Python functions. Let's look at how to add this self-documenting capability to our own module. API documentation in Python uses a facility called docstrings. Docstrings are literal strings, which occur as the first statement within a named block, such as a function or module. Let's document the fetch_words function. We use triple quoted strings even for single-line docstrings because they can easily be expanded to add more detail later. One Python convention for docstrings is documented in PEP 257, although it's not widely adopted. Various tools, such as Sphinx, are available to both HTML documentation from Python docstrings, and each tool mandates its preferred docstrings format. Our preference is to use the form presented in Googles Python Style Guide since it is amenable to being machine passed while still remaining readable at the console to humans. Now we've added the docstring, we can access it through Help from the REPL. We'll go ahead and add similar docstrings for our other functions, print items, and main. Each docstring begins with a short description of the purpose of the function followed by, as necessary, a list of the arguments to the function and the return value. Then we'll add one for the module itself. The module docstring should be placed at the beginning of the module before any statements. Now when we request help on the module as a whole, we get quite a lot of useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Documenting Your Code With Comments\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we'll introduce Python code comments. We believe docstrings are the right place for most documentation Python code. They explain how to consume the facilities your module provides rather than how it works. Ideally, your code should be clean enough that ancillary explanation is not required. Nevertheless, it's sometimes necessary to explain why a particular approach has been chosen or a particular technique used. And we can do that using Python comments. Comments in Python begin with a hash symbol and continue to the end of the line. Let's document the fact that it might not be immediately obvious why we are using sys.argv(1) rather than sys.argv(0). This is because the 0th argument of sys.argv is the module filename.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Whole Shebang\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the whole shebang. It's common on Unix-like systems to have the first line of a script include a special comment called a shebang. This begins with the usual hash as for any other comment followed by an exclamation mark. The shebang allows the program loader to identify which interpreter should be used to run the program. Shebangs have an additional purpose of conveniently documenting at the top of a file whether the Python code they're in is Python 2 or Python 3. The exact details of your shebang command depend on the location of Python on your system. Typical Python 3 shebangs use the Unix env program to locate Python 3 on your path environment variable, which importantly is compatible with Python virtual environments. A standard Python 3 shebang passes Python 3 to the user bin/env program. Don't worry if you're on Windows. Python includes machinery to make this work on Windows too. On Mac or Linux, we must mark our script as executable using the chmod command before the shebang will have any effect. Having done that, we can now run our script directly. Since Python 3.3, Python on Windows also supports the use of the shebang to make Python scripts directly executable with a correct version of the Python interpreter, even to the extent that shebangs that look like they should only work on Unix-like systems will work as expected on Windows. This works because Windows Python distributions now use a program called PyLauncher. PyLauncher, the executable for which is simply py.exe, will pass the shebang and locate the appropriate version of Python on your system. For example, on Windows in cmd shell, simply words.py followed by the URL as the command line argument will be sufficient to run your script with Python 3, even if you also have Python 2 installed. You can read more about PyLauncher on windows in PEP 397.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's review what we've covered in this module. Python code is placed in .py files called modules. Modules can be executed directly by passing them as the first argument to the Python interpreter. Modules can also be imported into the REPL, at which point all top-level statements in the module are executed in order. Named functions are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and the argument list in parentheses. We can return objects from functions using the return statement, and return statements without a parameter return None, as does the implicit return at the end of every function body. We can detect whether a module has been imported or executed by examining the value of the special double underscore name variable. If it is equal to the string double underscore main, our module has been executed directly as a program. By executing a function if this condition is met using the top-level if __name__ == __main__ idiom at the end of our module, we can make our module both usefully importable and executable, an important technique even for short scripts. Module code is only executed once on first import. The def keyword is a statement, which binds executable code to a function name. Command line arguments can be accessed as a list of strings accessible through the argv attribute of the sys module. The 0th command line argument is the script filename, so the item at index 1 is the first true argument. Literal strings is the first line of a function definition from the function's docstring. They are typically triple quoted multiline strings containing usage information. Function documentation provided in docstrings can be retrieved using the Help function in the REPL. Module docstrings should be placed near the beginning of the module prior to any Python statements, such as import statements. Comments in Python commence with the hash character and continue to the end of the line. The first line of the module can contain a special comment called a shebang allowing the program loader to launch the correct Python interpreter on all major platforms. Next time here on Python Fundamentals, we'll dig into Python's object model, looking at how values are passed to and returned from functions. We investigate the nature of dynamic typing in Python and focus on the rules of variable scope. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next module.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello. My name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the fourth module of the Python Fundamentals course where we seek to understand the Python object model, take a more in-depth look at some collection types we've met already, and introduce a few more collection types. We've already talked about and used variables in Python, but what exactly is a variable? What's going on when we do something as straightforward as assigning an integer to a variable? In this case, Python creates an int object with a value of 1000, an object reference with the name X, and arranges for X to refer to the int 1000 object. If we now modify the value of X with another assignment, what does not happen is a change in the value of the integer object. Integer objects in Python are immutable and cannot be changed. In fact, what happens is that Python creates a new immutable integer object with the value 500 and redirects the X reference to point at the new object. We now have no way of reaching the int 1000 object, and the Python garbage collector will reclaim it at some point. When we assign from one variable to another, we're really assigning from one object reference to another object reference, so both references now refer to the same object. If we now reassign X, we have X referring to an int 3000 object and Y referring to a separate int 500, and there is no work for the garbage collector to do because all objects are reachable from the live references. Let's dig a little deeper using the built-in id() function, which returns an integer identifier, which is unique and constant for the lifetime of the object. Let's rerun the previous experiment using id. Note that the id() function is seldom used in production Python code. Its main use is in object model tutorials such as this one, and as a debugging tool. Much more commonly used than the id() function is the is operator, which tests for equality of identity. That is it tests whether two references refer to the same object. We've already met the is operator earlier in the course when we tested for None. Even operations which seem naturally mutating in nature are not necessarily so. Consider the augmented assignment operator. Now let's look at that pictorially. We start with T referring to an int 5 object. Augmented assignment creates an int 2 without assigning a reference to it. It then adds the original int 5 with the new int 2 to produce a new int 7. Finally, it assigns T to the int 7 and the remaining ints are garbage collected. Python objects show this behavior for all types. The assignment operator only ever binds to names. It never copies an object by value. Let's look at another example using mutable objects, lists. We create a list object with three elements binding the list object to a reference named R, then assign R to a new reference S. When we modify the list referred to by S by changing the middle element, the R list has changed too since the names S and R in fact refer to the same object. Let's see that again with a diagram. First we assign R to a new list. We then assign S to R creating a new name for the existing list. If we modify S, we also modify R because we're modifying the same underlying object. S is R is true because both names refer to the same object. If you want to create an actual copy of an object such as a list, other techniques must be used, which we'll look at later. It turns out that Python doesn't really have variables in the metaphorical sense of a box holding a value. It only has named references to objects, and the references behave more like labels, which allow us to retrieve objects. That said, it's still common to talk about variables in Python. We will continue to do so secure in the knowledge that you now understand what's really going on behind the scenes. Let's contrast that behavior with a test for value equality or equivalence. We'll create two identical lists. Here we see that P and Q refer to different objects, but that the objects they refer to have the same value. Of course an object should always be equivalent to itself. Here's how that looks pictorially. We have two separate list objects each with a single reference to it. The values contained in the objects are the same. That is they are equivalent or value equal even though they have different identities. Value equality and identity are fundamentally different notions of equality, and it's important to keep them separate in your mind. It's also worth noting that value comparison is something that is defined programatically. When you define types, you can control how that class determines value equality. In contrast, identity comparison is defined by the language, and you can't change that behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Argument Passing\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at how all of this relates to function arguments and return values. Let's define a function at the REPL, which appends a value to a list and prints the modified list. First the list and then a function modify, which appends to and prints the list. The function accepts a single formal argument named K. We call modify passing our list M as a the actual argument, which indeed prints the modified list with four elements. But what does our list reference outside the function now refer to? The list referred to by M has been modified because it is the self-same list referred to by K inside the function. When we pass an object reference to a function, we're essentially assigning from the actual argument reference, in this case M, to the formal argument reference, in this case K. As we have seen, assignment causes the reference being assigned to refer to the same object as the reference being assigned from. This is exactly what's going on here. If you want a function to modify a copy of an object, it's the responsibility of the function to do the copying. Let's look at another example, first a new list F that refers the three elements, then a function which replaces the list, which we now call with the actual argument F. This is much as we'd expect; however, what's the value of F? F still refers to the original unmodified list. This time the function did not modify the object that was passed in. What's going on? Well, the object reference named F was assigned to the formal argument named G, so G and F did indeed refer to the same object just as in the previous example. However, on the first line of the function we reassigned the reference G to point it to a newly constructed list 17, 28, 45, so within the function the reference to the original 14, 23, 37 list was overwritten, although the unmodified object itself was still pointed to by the F reference outside the function. So, we see that it's quite possible to modify the objects through function argument references, but also possible to rebind the argument reference to new values. If you wanted to change the contents of the list and have the changes seen outside the function, you could modify the contents of the list like this, (Typing) and indeed the contents of F have been modified. Function arguments are transferred by what is called pass by object reference. This means that the value of the reference is copied into the function argument, not the value of the referred object. No objects are copied. The return statement uses the same pass by object reference semantics as function arguments. We can demonstrate this simply by writing a simple function which returns its only argument. Creating an object such as a list and passing it through this simple function returns the very same object we passed in showing that no copies of the list were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Function Arguments in Detail\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we understand the distinction between object references and objects, we'll look at some more capabilities of function arguments. The formal function arguments specified when a function is defined with the def keyword are a comma separated list of the argument names. These arguments can be made optional by providing default values. Consider a function which prints a simple banner to the console. This function takes two arguments, the second of which is provided with a default value, in this case a hyphen, in a literal string. When we define functions using default arguments, the parameters with default arguments must come after those without default; otherwise, we will get a syntax error. Within the body of the function, we multiply our border string by the length of the message string. This shows how we can determine the number of items in a Python collection using the built-in len function, and secondly how multiplying a string, in this case the single character string border, by an integer results in a new string containing the original string repeated a number of times. We use that feature here to make a string equal in length to our message. We then print the full-width border, the message, and the border again. When we call our banner function, we don't need to supply the border string because we provided a default value. However, if we do provide the option argument, it is used. In production code, this function call is not particularly self-documenting. We can improve that situation by naming the border argument at the call site. In this case, the message string is called a positional argument and the border string a keyword argument. The actual positional arguments are matched up in sequence with the formal arguments whereas the keyword arguments are matched by name. If we use keyword arguments for both of our parameters, we have the freedom to supply them in any order, although remember that all keyword arguments must be specified after the positional arguments. It's crucial to have an appreciation of exactly when the expression provided as a default argument value is evaluated to avoid a common pitfall which frequently ensnares newcomers to Python. Let's examine this question closely using the Python Standard Library time module. We can easily get the time as a readable string by using the ctime function of the time module. Let's write a function which uses a value retrieved from ctime as a default argument value. So far so good, but notice what happens when you call show_default() again a few seconds later, and again. The display time never progresses. Recall how we said that def is a statement that when executed binds a function definition to a function name. Well, the default argument expressions are evaluated only once when the def statement is executed. Normally this causes no problems when the default is a simple immutable constant such as an integer or a string, but it can be a confusing trap for the unwary that usually shows up in the form of using mutable collections as argument defaults. Let's take a closer look. Consider the function which uses an empty list as a default argument. It accepts a menu, which will be a list of strings; appends the item spam to the list; and returns the modified menu. Let's create a simple breakfast of bacon and eggs and naturally add spam to it. We'll do something similar for lunch. Nothing unexpected so far. But look what happens when you rely on the default argument by not passing an existing menu. When we append spam to an empty menu, we get just spam. Let's do that again. When we exercise the default the second time, we get two spams and three and four. What's happening here is that the empty list used for the default argument is created exactly once when the def statement is executed. The first time we fell back on the default this list has spam added to it. When we used the default the second time, the list still contains that item, and a second instance of spam is added to it making two ad infinitum, or perhaps ad nauseam would be more appropriate. The solution to this is straightforward, but perhaps not obvious. Always use immutable objects such as integers or strings for default values. Following this advice, we can solve this particular case by using the immutable None object as a sentinel. And now our add_spam function works as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's Type System\n",
      "\n",
      "Programming languages can be distinguished by several characteristics, but one of the most important is the nature of their type systems. Python can be characterized as having a dynamic and strong type system. Let's investigate what that means. Dynamic typing means that the type of an object reference isn't resolved until the program is running and needn't be specified up front when the program is written. Take a look at this simple function for adding two objects. Nowhere in this definition do we mention any types. We can use add with integers, floats, strings, or indeed any type for which the addition operator has been defined. These examples illustrate the dynamism of the type system. The two arguments A and B of the add function can reference any type of object. The term strong type system is less rigorously defined than dynamic, but a common definition is that the language will not in general implicitly convert objects between types. The strength of the Python type system can be demonstrated by attempting to add types for which addition has not been defined such as strings and floats. This produces a type error because Python will not in general perform implicit conversions between object types or otherwise attempt to coerce one type to another, the exception being the conversion to bool used for if statements and while-loop predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Variable Scoping\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have seen, no type declarations are necessary, and variables are essentially just untyped name bindings to objects. As such, they can be rebound or reassigned as often as necessary, even to objects of different types. But when we bind a name to an object, where is that binding stored? To answer that question, we must look at scopes and scoping rules in Python. There are four main types of scope in Python arranged in a hierarchy. Each scope is a context in which names are stored in which they can be looked up. The four scopes from narrowest to broadest are: Local, those names defined inside the current function. Enclosing, those names defined inside any and all enclosing functions. This scope isn't important for the contents of this Python fundamentals course. Global, those names defined at the top level of a module. Each module brings with it a new global scope. And finally Built-in, those names built into the Python language through the special built-ins module. Together these scopes comprise the LEGB rule. Names are looked up in the narrowest relevant context. It's important to note that scopes in Python do not correspond to the source code blocks as demarcated by indentation. For-loops, with-blocks, and the like do not introduce new nested scopes. Consider our words.py module. It contains the following global names: Main bound by the def main statement, sys bound when sys is imported, __name__ provided by the Python runtime, urlopen bound from the urllib request module, fetch_words bound by the def fetch_words statement, and print_items bound by the def print_items statement. Module scope name bindings are typically introduced by import statements and function or class definitions. It is possible to use other objects at module scope, and this is typically used for constants, although it can be used for variables. Within the fetch_words function we have the six local names: Word bound by the inner for-loop, line_words bound by assignment, line bound by the outer for-loop, story_words bound by assignment, url bound by the formal function argument, and story bound by the with statement. Each of these is brought into existence at first use and continues to live within the function scope until the function completes at which point the references will be destroyed. Very occasionally we need to rebind a global name at module scope from within a function. Consider the following simple module. If we save this module in scopes.py, we can import it into the REPL for experimentation. When show_count() is called, Python looks up the count name in the local namespace L, doesn't find it, so it looks in the next most outer namespace, in this case the global module namespace G where it finds the name count and prints the referred object. Now we call set_count with a new value and call show_count again. You might be surprised that show_count displays 0 after the call to set_count, so let's work through what's happening. When we call set_count, the assignment count = c binds the object referred to by the formal argument C to a new name count in the innermost namespace context, which is the scope of the current function. No lookup is performed for the global count at module scope. We have created a new variable which shadows and thereby prevents access to the global of the same name. To avoid this situation, we need to instruct Python to consider use of the count name in the set_count function to resolve to the count in the module namespace. We can do this by using the global keyword. Let's modify set_count to do so. Quit and restart the Python interpreter and exercise our revised module, which now demonstrates the required behavior.\n",

      "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. We follow patterns not to kill complexity, but to master it. As we have shown, all variables in Python are references to objects, even basic types such as integers. This thorough approach to object-orientation is a strong theme in Python, and practically everything in Python is an object including functions and modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything Is an Object\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python it's important to remember that everything is an object, primitive objects, functions, modules, and on and on. It's easy to see that when you start to explore even simple pieces of code. Let's go back to our words module and experiment with it further at the REPL. On this occasion we'll import just the module. The import statement binds a module object to the name words in the current namespace. We can determine the type of any object by using the type built-in function. If we want to see the attributes of an object, we can use the dir built-in function in a Python interactive session to introspect an object. The dir function returns a sorted list of the module attributes including the ones we defined such as the function fetch words, any imported names such as sys and urlopen, and various special attributes delimited by double underscores such as double underscore name and double underscore doc, which reveal the inner workings of Python. We can use the type function on any of these attributes to learn more about them. For instance, we can see that fetch_words is a function object. We can in turn call dir on the function to reveal its attributes, and we see that function objects have many special attributes to do with how Python functions are implemented behind the scenes. For now, we'll just look at a couple of simple attributes. As you might expect, this is the name of the function object as a string, and this is the docstring we provided. These give us some clues as to how the built-in help function might be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "We've covered a lot of important concepts about how the Python language works in this module. Let's summarize what we've been over. Better to think of Python working in terms of named references to objects rather than variables and values. Assignment doesn't put a value in a box. It attaches a name tag to an object. Assigning from one reference to another puts two name tags on the same object. The Python garbage collector will reclaim unreachable objects, those objects with no name tag. The id() function returns a unique and constant identifier, which should rarely if ever be used in production. The is operator determines equality of identity, that is whether two names refer to the same object. We can test for equivalence using the double equals operator. Function arguments are passed by object reference, so functions can modify their arguments if they are mutable objects. If a formal function argument is rebound through assignment, the reference to the passed in object is lost. To change a mutable argument, you should replace its contents rather than replacing the whole object. The return statement also passes by object-reference. No copies are made. Function arguments can be specified with defaults. Default argument expressions are evaluated only once when the def statement is executed. Python uses dynamic typing, so we don't need to specify reference types in advance. Python uses strong typing. Types are not coerced to match. Python reference names are looked up in one of four nested scopes according to the LEGB rule: Local to functions, in Enclosing functions, in the Global or module namespace, and Built-ins. Global references can be read from a local scope. Assigning to global references from a local scope requires that the reference be declared global using the global keyword. Everything in Python is an object including modules and functions. They can be treated just like other objects. The import and def keywords result in binding to named references. The built-in type function can be used to determine the type of an object. The built-in dir function can be used to introspect an object and return a list of its attribute names. The name of a function or module object can be accessed through its double underscore name attribute. The docstring for a function or module object can be accessed through its double underscore doc attribute. In passing, we also saw that we can use len() to measure the length of a string. If we multiply a string by an integer, we get a new string with multiple copies of the operand string. This is called the repetition operation.

      "Hi. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the fifth module of the Python Fundamentals course where we look in more depth at the built-in collection types of the Python language and explore the various protocols that unite them. In this module we'll revisit some collection types we've already explored: Str or string, the immutable sequence of Unicode codepoints; list, the mutable sequence of objects; and dict, the mutable mapping from immutable keys to mutable objects. We'll also cover some new ones: Tuple, the immutable sequence of objects; range for arithmetic progressions of integers; and set, a mutable collection of unique immutable objects. We won't cover the bytes type further here. We've already discussed its essential differences with str, and most of what we learned about str can also be applied to bytes. This is not an exhaustive list of Python collection types, but it's completely sufficient for the overwhelming majority of Python 3 programs you'll encounter in the wild or are likely to write yourself. In this module we'll be covering these collections in this order, and then round off with an overview of the protocols that unite these collections, which allow them to be used in consistent and predictable ways. First up is tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuple\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuples in Python are immutable sequences of arbitrary objects. Once created, the objects within them cannot be replaced or removed, and new elements cannot be added. Tuples have a similar literal syntax to lists except that they are delimited by parentheses rather than square brackets. Here's a literal tuple containing a string, a float, and an integer. We can access the elements of a tuple by zero-based index using square brackets, and we can determine the number of elements in the tuple using the built-in len function. We can iterate over tuples using the for loop, and we can concatenate tuples using the plus operator. Tuples can be repeated using the multiplication operator. Since tuples can contain any object, it's perfectly possible to have nested tuples. We use repeated application of the indexing operator to get to the inner elements. Sometimes a single element tuple is required. To write this, we can't just use a simple number in parentheses. This is because Python pauses that as an integer enclosed in the president's controlling parentheses of a math expression. To create a single element tuple, we make use of the trailing comma separator, which we're allowed to use when specifying literal tuples, lists, and dictionaries. A single element with a trailing comma is passed as a single element tuple. This leaves us with the problem of how to specify an empty tuple. In actuality the answer is simple. We just use empty parentheses. In many cases, the parentheses of literal tuples may be omitted. This feature is often used when returning multiple values from a function. Here we make a function to return the minimum and maximum values of a series, the hard work being done by the two built-in functions min and max. Returning multiple values as tuple is often used in conjunction with a wonderful feature of Python called tuple unpacking. Tuple unpacking is a destructuring operation, which allows us to unpack data structures into named references. For example, we can assign the result of our minmax function to two new references like this. Tuple unpacking works with arbitrarily nested tuples, although not with other data structures. This in turn leads to the beautiful Python idiom for swapping two or more variables. Should you need to create a tuple from an existing collection object such as a list, you can use the tuple constructor, here also shown for strings. Finally, as with most collection types in Python, we can test for containment using the in operator or nonmembership with the not in operator. While that just about wraps up our look at tuple, let's move onto the next collection type.\n",

      "We've covered strings at some length already, but we'll take time now to explore their capabilities in a little more depth. Recall that str is a homogeneous immutable sequence of Unicode codepoints, which for the most part we can consider to be the same as characters. Let's put str through its paces. As with any other Python sequence, we can determine the length of a string with a built-in len function. For instance, if we wanted to know how many characters were in the Welsh place name llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, we could call len on this string and get the answer of 58. Concatenation of strings is supported using the plus operator. For instance, it's easy to turn \"New\" + \"found\" + \"land\" into Newfoundland, although for joining large numbers of strings the join method should be preferred because it's substantially more efficient. This is because concatenation using the addition operator or its augmented assignment version can lead to the generation of large numbers of temporaries with consequent costs for memory allocation and copies. Let's see how join is used. Join is a method on str which takes a collection of strings as an argument and produces a new string by inserting a separator between each of them. An interesting aspect of join is how the separator is specified. It is the string on which join is called. As with many parts of Python, an example is the best explanation. To join a list of HTML color code strings into a semicolon separated string, we call join on the separator we wish to use with a semicolon and pass in the list of strings to be joined. We can then split them up again using the split() method, which we've already encountered, but this time we're going to provide its optional argument. A widespread and fast path and idiom for concatenating together a collection of strings is to join using the empty string as the separator. The way may not be obvious at first. To concatenate, invoke join on empty text, something for nothing. This use of join is often confusing to the uninitiated, but with use the approach taken by Python will be appreciated as natural and elegant. Another very useful string method is partition(), which divides a string into three sections, the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. Partition returns a tuple, so this is commonly used in conjunction with tuple unpacking. Here we separate the string \"London:Edinburgh\" into three by partitioning around the colon. Often we're not interested in capturing the separator value, so you might see the underscore variable name used. This is not treated in a special way by the Python language, but there's an unwritten convention that the underscore variable is for unused or dummy values. This convention is supported by many Python aware development tools, which will suppress unused variable warnings for underscore. One of the most interesting and frequently used string methods is format. This supercedes, although does not replace, the string interpolation technique used in all the versions of Python and which we do not teach here. The format() method can be usefully called on any string containing so-called replacement fields, which are surrounded by curly braces. The objects provided as arguments to format are converted to strings and used to populate these fields. The field names, in this case 0 and 1, are matched up with the positional arguments to format, and each argument is converted to a string. A field name may be used more than once such as in this example. However, if the field names are used exactly once and in the same order as the arguments they can be omitted. If keyword arguments are supplied to formats, then named fields can be used instead of indexes. Note in this example how we've used the ability to split long statements over multiple lines so long as the split is inside open parentheses, brackets, or braces. In this case, we split the argument list with a format() method inside its open parentheses. This technique can greatly aid the formatting of Python code whilst keeping a manageable line length. It's possible to index into sequences using square brackets inside the replacement field. Here we've assigned a tuple to a variable pos, and then we pass pos as a keyword argument to format. We access the elements of pos inside the replacement fields within the string. We can even access object attributes. Here we pass the whole math module to format using a keyword argument. Remember, modules are objects too. Then we access two of its attributes from within the replacement fields, pi and e. Format strings also give us a lot of control over field alignment and floating point formatting. Here's the same with the constants displayed to only three decimal places. We don't cover all of the intricacies of the Python formatting mini language. If you want to know more, consult the documentation. Now we've covered the fundamentals of the string type. We recommend you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the other string methods. Remember, you can find out what they are using simply help str. Let's move on now and look at the next collection type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Range\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's move on and look at range, which really is a collection rather than a container. A range is a type of sequence used for representing an arithmetic progression of integers. Ranges are created by calls to the range constructor, and there is no literal form. Most typically we supply only the stop value. In this case we create a range from 0 to 5 simply by supplying the stop value of 5. Ranges are sometimes used to create consecutive integers for use as loop counters. Note that the stop value supplied to range is one past the end of the sequence, which is why the previous loop terminated at 4 and didn't print 5. We can also supply a starting value if we wish such as in this call range 5, 10. Wrapping this in a call to the list constructor is a handy way to force production of each item. The so-called half-open range convention with a stop value not being included in the sequence at first seems strange, but actually makes a lot of sense if you're dealing with consecutive ranges because the end specified by one range is the start of the next range. Range also supports a step argument, which controls the interval between successive numbers. Note that in order to use the step argument we must supply all three arguments. Range is curious in that it determines what its arguments mean by counting them. Providing only one argument means it is the stop value, two arguments are start and stop, and three arguments are start, stop, and step. Python's range works this way so the first argument start can be made optional, something which isn't normally possible. Furthermore, range doesn't support keyword arguments. You might almost describe it as unpythonic. At this point, we're going to show you another example of poorly styled Python code, one you can and should avoid. Here's a poor way to print the elements in a list using range, len, and list indexing. Although this works, it's most definitely unpythonic. Always prefer to use iteration over objects themselves. If for some reason you need a counter, you should use the built-in enumerate() function, which returns an iterable series of pairs, each pair being a tuple. The first element of the pair is the index of the current item, and the second element of the pair is the item itself. We can improve this even further by using tuple unpacking and avoiding having to deal directly with the tuple. Because of the strong iteration primitives built into Python, ranges aren't widely used in modern Python code. Let's move on and look at the next collection type.\n",

      "List\n",
      "\n",
      "We've already covered lists a little, and we've been making good use of them. We know how to create lists using the literal syntax, add to them using the append method, and get at and modify their contents using the square brackets indexing. Now let's take a deeper look. Let's start by making a list containing the words show how to index into sequences. We'll do this by calling the split method on a string. We're already familiar with how 0 and positive integers index the list from the front using a zero-based index. Here we extract the fifth element by using the index 4. One very convenient feature of lists and other Python sequences, for this applies to tuples too, is the ability to index from the end rather than from the beginning. This is achieved by supplying negative indexes. For example, we can access the fifth element from the end by supplying the index -5. The last element of the sequence is at index -1. Negative indexing is much more elegant than the clunky alternative of computing the forward index by subtracting the backward index from the length of the sequence. Note that indexing with -0 is the same as indexing with 0, returning the first element in the list. Because there is no distinction between 0 and -0, negative indexing is essentially one-based rather than zero-based. This is good to keep in mind if you're calculating indexes with even moderately complex logic. Off by one arrows can creep into negative indexing fairly easily. Slicing is a form of extended indexing which allows us to refer to portions of a list. To use it, we pass the start and stop indices of a half-open range separated by a colon as the square brackets index argument. Here we slice three words from the list by passing the start index 1 and the stop index 4. This facility can be combined with negative indexing. For example, to take all the elements except the first and last, slice between 1 and -1. Both the start and stop indices are optional. To slice all elements from the third to the end of the list, supply only 3: as the argument to the index operator. And to slice all elements from the beginning of the list up to, but not including the third, supply :3 as the argument to the index operator. Notice that these two lists together form the whole list demonstrating the convenience of the half-open range convention. Since both start and stop indices are optional, it's entirely possible to omit both and retrieve all of the elements, and indeed this last example is an important idiom for copying a list. This new list has a distinct identity, but an equivalent value. It's important to understand that although we have a new list object, which can be independently modified, the elements within it are references to the same objects referred to by the original list. In the event that these objects are both mutable and modified as opposed to replaced, the change will be seen in both lists. We teach this full slice list copying idiom because you're likely to see it in the wild, and it's not immediately obvious what it does. You should be aware that there are other more readable ways of copying a list such as the copy() method or even a simple call to the list() constructor passing the list to be copied. Largely, it's a matter of taste. Our preference is for the third form using the list() constructor since it has the advantage of working with any iterable series as the source and not just lists. You must be aware, however, that all of these techniques perform a shallow copy. That is, they create a new list containing the same object references as the source list, but don't copy the referred to objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shallow Copies\n",
      "\n",
      "To demonstrate this, we'll used nested lists with the inner list serving as mutable objects. Here's a list containing two elements, each of which is itself a list. Let's look at what's going on under the covers as Python constructs this data structure. First, two integer objects are created containing the values 1 and 2 respectively. The elements of the first inner list are references to these two integer objects. Now two more integer objects are created containing the values 3 and 4 respectively. The elements of the second inner list are references to these integer objects. Now the outer list is created, its elements containing references to the two inner lists. Finally, the reference named A is bound to the outer list. What happens when we copy the list? Here we use the full slice technique, but any of the three techniques we've shown will have the same effect. We're requesting a copy of outer list, so it's elements, which contain references to the two inner lists, are duplicated. These references refer to the same inner lists as the original list A. Once the list copy is complete, we bind a new reference named B to the new list. We can confirm that the lists are distinct objects by testing with A is B, which returns False. They do, however, contain equivalent values, which we can test with A == B, which returns True. Not only are the elements at a(0) and b(0) equivalent, they actually refer to the same inner list object. Now let's replace the element at a(0) with a new list containing 8 and 9. This results in the construction of two new integer objects containing 8 and 9 respectively and the new list, the elements of which are references to these two new integer objects. The reference in a(0) is redirected to point to this new inner list object, and we can confirm that a(0) now indeed points to the new list while b(0) is unmodified. What happens if we now append to the inner list referred to by a(1)? Let's append a new integer object containing the value 5. The new integer object is created and is referred to by an additional element in the inner list referred to by a(1), so a(1) now refers to a list containing integers 3, 4, 5. Significantly, because a(1) and b(1) refer to the same inner list, the list accessible through b(1) has also been modified. Following these manipulations, the data structure referred to by A is a list containing two elements, each of which itself is a list. The first inner list contains 8 and 9, and the second inner list contains 3, 4, and 5. The data structure referred to by B is also a list containing two inner lists. The first element refers to a list containing 1 and 2, and the second element also refers to the 3, 4, 5 list.\n",
      "\n",
      "List Repetition\n",
      "\n",
      "As for strings and tuples, lists support repetition using the multiplication operator. It's simple enough to use. Here we repeat a list containing the integers 21 and 37 four times. This form is rarely spotted in the wild. It's most often used for initializing a list of size known in advance to a constant value such as 0. Here we create a list initialized with nine 0 elements. Be aware though that in the case of mutable elements the same trap for the unwary that occurred with list copying lurks here since repetition will repeat the reference without copying the value. Let's demonstrate using nested lists as our mutable elements again. We'll repeat a list five times. The mutable element it contains will be another list containing elements, two -1 and +1. Let's see what Python needs to do to construct this data structure. First, two integer objects are created containing the values -1 and +1 respectively. These are referred to by the two elements of the inner list. Python then creates the outer list and the ranges for its single element to contain a reference to the inner list. Now the repetition operation is applied. A new list is created containing five elements, each of which contains a copy of the single element in the original outer list. All of these elements contain references to the same inner list object. Now the temporary single element outer list can be disposed of. Finally, this whole data structure is bound to a new named reference, S. As expected, S contains five elements, each of which is the -1, +1 in a list. Now let's append the integer 7 to the fourth inner list at index 3 in the outer list. This creates a new integer object and a new element on the inner list containing a reference to that integer object. We can see that all of the elements of the outer list have been modified because they do in fact all refer to the same inner list.\n",
      "\n",
      "More on List\n",
      "\n",
      "To find an element in a list, use the index method passing the object you're searching for. The elements are compared for equivalence or value equality until the one you're looking for is found and its index returned. Here we create a list W containing the words the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog using the string split method. Searching for fox using the index method returns the integer 3, which of course allows us to get ahold of that element. If you search for a value that isn't present like unicorn, you will receive a ValueError, which we'll learn how to handle gracefully in the next module. Another means of searching is to count matching elements using the count method. Here we count occurrences of the word the. If you just want to test for membership, you can use the in operator or for nonmembership using the not in operator. Elements are removed from lists using a keyword with which we have not yet become acquainted, del. The del keyword takes a single parameter, which is a reference to a list element and removes it from the list shortening the list in the process. Here we make a string U containing the words jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz using the string split method. We can delete the fourth element using del u(3) leaving jackdaws love my sphinx of quartz. It's also possible to remove elements by value rather than by position using the remove method. Here we pass jackdaws to that method giving us love my sphinx of quartz. This is of course equivalent to using the del statement and the index method in combination. Attempting to remove an item which is not present such as pyramid results in a ValueError. Items can be inserted into lists using the insert method, which accepts the index of the new item and the new item itself. Here we create a list A containing the words I accidently the whole universe. We insert the word destroyed at index 2 using a call to the insert method giving us I accidentally destroyed the whole universe. We can covert this list of words back into a string by calling the string join operator on a space separator.\n",

      "Growing Lists\n",
      "\n",
      "Concatenating lists using the addition operator results in a new list without modification of the operands whereas the augmented assignment operator += modifies the assignee in place. This can also be achieved using the extend() list method. All of these techniques work with any iterable series, not just lists on the right hand side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reversing and Sorting Lists\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we move on from lists, let's look at two operations which rearrange the elements in place, reversing and sorting. A list can be reversed in place simply by calling its reverse() method. Similarly, a list can be sorted in place using the sort() method. The sort() method accepts two optional arguments, key and reverse. The latter is self-explanatory, and when set to true gives a descending sort. The key parameter is more interesting. It accepts any callable object, which is then used to extract a key from each item. The items will then be sorted according to the relative ordering of these keys. There are several types of callable objects in Python, although the only one we have encountered so far is the humble function. For example, the built-in len function is a callable object, which is used to determine the length of the collection such as a string. Consider the following list of words: Not perplexing do handwriting family where I illegibly know doctors. By passing a reference to the len function as the key argument to the sort() method of the H list, we can order these words in order of length. Again, we can join the list of words back together with a call to the join operator on a space separator giving the almost sentence I do not know where family doctors illegibly perplexing handwriting. Sometimes an insitu sort or reversal is not what is required. For example, it may cause a function argument to be modified giving the function confusing side effects, which it would not otherwise have. For out of place equivalence of the reverse and sort list methods, you can use the reversed and sorted built- in functions, which return a reverse iterator and a new sorted list respectively. Here we use sorted() to sort a list of numbers, X, which returns a new list, Y. Notice that the original list X is unmodified. Here we use reversed() to reverse a list of numbers, P. Notice how we need to use the list constructor to evaluate the result of reversed. This is because reversed returns an iterator, a topic we will cover in much more detail later. These two functions have the advantage that they'll work on any finite length iterable source object. We've learned a lot about lists in this section together with some more general techniques such as slicing that can be used with other sequences including tuples and strings. Let's move on and look at the next collection type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionary\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll now return to dictionaries, which lie at the heart of many Python programs including the Python interpreter itself. We briefly looked at literal dictionaries previously seeing how they are delimited with curly braces and contain comma separated key-value pairs with each pair tied together by a colon. The values are accessible via the keys. The keys must be unique within any single dictionary, although it's fine to have duplicate values so long as they're associated with different keys. Internally the dictionary maintains pairs of references to the key objects and the value objects. The key objects must be immutable, so strings, numbers, and tuples are fine, but lists are not. The value objects can be mutable, and in practice often are. Our example URL map uses strings for both keys and values, which is fine. You should never rely on the order of items in the dictionary. It's essentially random and may even vary between different runs of the same program. As for the other collections, there's also a named constructor, dict(), which can covert other types to the dictionaries. We can use the constructor to copy from an iterable series of key-value pairs stored in tuples like this. Recall that the items in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order. So long as the keys are legitimate Python identifiers, it's even possible to create a dictionary directly from keyword arguments passed the dict. As with lists, dictionary copying is shallow by default copying only the references to the key and value objects, not the value objects themselves. There are two means of copying a dictionary of which we most commonly see the second. The first technique is to use the copy() method. Here we copy a dictionary of color codes. Note that we supply them in hexadecimal, but they're echoed back to us in decimal. The second means of copying is simply to pass an existing dictionary to the dict constructor. If you need to extend a dictionary with definitions from another dictionary, you can use the update() method. This is called on the dictionary to be updated and passed the contents of the dictionary, which is to be merged in. Here we merge in some additional color codes into our existing dictionary. If the argument to update includes keys which are already present in the target dictionary, the values associated with these keys are replaced in the target by the corresponding values from the source. As we have seen in an earlier module, dictionaries are iterable, so they can be used with for loops. The dictionary yields the next key on each iteration, and we retrieve the corresponding value by lookup using the square brackets operator. Notice that the keys are returned in an arbitrary order, which is neither the order in which they were specified nor any other meaningful sort order. If we want to iterate over only the values, we can use the values() dictionary method. This returns an object which provides an iterable view onto the dictionary values without causing the values to be copied. There is no efficient or convenient way to retrieve the corresponding key from a value, so we only print the values here in this example. In the interest of symmetry, there's also a keys() method which provides a view onto the keys of the dictionary, although it's not often used because default iteration of dictionaries is by key. Often though we want to iterate over the keys and values in tandem. Each key-value pair in a dictionary is called an item, and we can get ahold of an iterable view of the items using the items() dictionary method. When iterated over, the items view yields each key-value pair as a tuple. By using tuple unpacking in the for statement, we can get both the key and value in one operation without the extra lookup. The membership test for dictionaries use the in and not in operators and work only on the keys. Here we create a dictionary mapping ISO currency codes to Unicode currency symbols. We use the membership testing operators to show that the New Zealand dollar is in the list of symbols whereas the Macedonian Denar is not in the list of symbols. Here we use the del keyword to remove the fictional element unobtainium from our periodic table. The keys in a dictionary should be immutable, although the values can be modified. Here's a dictionary which maps the element symbol to a list of mass numbers for different isotopes of that element. See how we split the dictionary literal over multiple lines. That's allowed because the curly braces for the dictionary literal are open at the point of the line break as string keys are immutable, which is a good thing for the correct functioning of the dictionary, but there's no problem with modifying the dictionary values in the event that we discover some new isotopes. Here the augmented assignment operator is applied to the list object accessed through the H for hydrogen key. The dictionary is not being modified at all here, but the list is being extended. Of course the dictionary itself is mutable. We know we can add new items. Here we add three isotopes of nitrogen. With compound data structures such as our table of isotopes, it can be helpful to have them printed out in a much more readable form. We can do this with the Python Standard Library pretty printing module called pprint, which contains a function called pprint. To use it, it's best to do something like from pprint import pprint as pp. If we didn't bind the pprint function to a different name pp, the function reference would overwrite the module reference preventing further access to the contents of the module. Arguably it's poor design to have a module containing functions of the same name because of this issue. Anyway, by using pp(m) we get a much more comprehensible display of our table of isotopes. Let's move on from dictionaries and look at a new built-in data structure we have not yet met, the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set\n",
      "\n",
      "The set data type is an unordered collection of unique elements. The collection is mutable in so far as elements can be added and removed from the set, but each element must itself be immutable very much like the keys of a dictionary. Sets have a literal form very similar to dictionaries, again delimited by curly braces, but each item is a single object rather than a pair joined by a colon. Note that the set is unordered and of course has type set. Recall that empty curly braces create an empty dictionary, so to create an empty set we must resort to the set() constructor with no arguments. This is the form that Python echoes back to us too. The set() constructor can create a set from any iterable series such as a list. Duplicates are discarded. In fact, a common use of sets is to efficiently remove duplicate items from a series of objects. Here we remove duplicates from the list 1, 4, 2, 1, 7, 9, 9 resulting in the set 1, 2, 4, 9, 7. Naturally sets are iterable, although the order is arbitrary. Membership is a fundamental operation for sets, and as with the other collection types is performed using the in and not in operators. To add a single element to the set, simply use the add method. Adding an element that already exists has no effect, and neither does it produce an error. Multiple elements can be added in one go from any iterable series including another set using the update method. Two methods are provided for removing elements from sets. The first, remove, requires that the element to be removed is present in the set; otherwise, a KeyError is given. The second method discard is less fussy and simply has no effect if the item is not a member of the set. As with the other built-in collections, set sports a copy() method, which performs a shallow copy of the set copying references, but not the objects they refer to. As we have already shown, the set constructor may also be used. Perhaps the most useful aspect of the set type is group of powerful set algebra operations which are provided. These allow us to easily compute set unions, set differences, and set intersections and to evaluate whether two sets have subset, superset, or disjoint relations. To demonstrate these methods, we'll construct some sets of people according to various phenotypes. Olivia, Harry, Lily, Jack, and Amelia have blue eyes. Harry, Jack, Amelia, Mia, and Joshua have blond hair. Only Harry and Amelia can smell hydrogen cyanide. Harry, Lily, Amelia, and Lola can taste phenylthiocarbamide or PTC. Mia, Joshua, Lily, and Oliva have O type blood, Amelia and Jack have B type blood, Harry has A type blood, and Joshua and Lola have AB type blood. To find all the people with blond hair, blue eyes, or both, we can use the union method, which collects together all of the elements, which are in either or both set. We can demonstrate that union is a commutative operation. That is, we can swap the order of the operands using the value equality operator to check for equivalence of the resulting sets. To find all the people with blond hair and blue eyes, we can use the set intersection method, which collects together only the elements which are present in both sets. This is also commutative. To identify the people with blond hair who don't have blue eyes, we can use the set difference method. This finds all of the elements which are in the first set, which are not in the second set. This is non-commutative because the people with blond hair who don't have blue eyes are not the same as the people who have blue eyes, but don't have blond hair. However, if you want to determine which people have exclusively blond hair or blue eyes, but not both, we can use the symmetric_difference method. This collects all the elements which are in the first set or the second set, but not both. As you can tell from the name, symmetric_difference is indeed commutative. In addition, three predicate methods are provided, which tell us about the relationships between sets. We can check whether one set is the subset of another set using the issubset method. For example, to check whether all of the people who can smell hydrogen cyanide also have blond hair, you smell_hcn.issubset(blond_hair). This checks that all of the elements of the first set are also present in the second set. To test whether all of the people who can taste phenylthiocarbamide can also taste hydrogen cyanide, use the issuperset method. To test that two sets have no members in common, use the isdisjoint method. For example, your blood type is either A or O, never both. We encourage you to experiment with these methods and become comfortable using them. They can make for some very elegant solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collection Protocols\n",
      "\n",
      "That completes our tour of the collection types in Python, but we're not quite finished. Let's complete this module by looking at the protocols which unite these collections and allow them to be used in standard ways. In Python, a protocol is a set of operations or methods that a type must support if it is to implement that protocol. Protocols needn't be defined in the source code as separate interfaces or base classes as they would in an anomaly typed language such as C# or Java. It's sufficient to simply have an object provide functioning implementations of those operations. We can organize the different collections we've encountered in Python according to which protocols they support. Support for protocol demands specific behavior from a type. As you can see from this table, most of the collection types we've looked at support the container, size, and iterable protocols. Many of them are also sequences. The immutable protocols are each represented by only one type we have encountered. The container protocol requires that membership testing using the in and not in operators be supported. The size protocol requires that the number of elements in a collection can be determined by passing the collection to the built-in len function. Iteration is such an important concept we're devoting a whole module to it later in this course. In short though, iterables provide a means of yielding elements one-by-one as they're requested. One important property of iterables is that they can be used with for loops. The sequence protocol requires that items can be retrieved using square brackets with an integer index, that items can be searched for with the index method, that items can be counted with the count method, and that a reversed copy of the sequence can be produced with the reversed built-in function. We won't cover the mutable sequence, mutable mapping, and mutable set protocols here since we've only covered one representative of each protocol, so the generality afforded by the protocol concept doesn't gain as much as this juncture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "We've covered a lot of ground in this module. Let's try to summarize. Tuples are immutable sequence types. They have a literal syntax, which is optional parentheses, around a comma separated list. Notably, the optional trailing comma must be used for single element tuples to disambiguate them from parenthesized integers. Tuples are particularly useful for multiple return values from functions, and tuple unpacking useful for destructuring those return values. Tuple unpacking also has an interesting idiomatic use for swapping variables. Strings are also immutable sequence types, but specifically of Unicode codepoints. String concatenation is most efficiently performed with the join() method rather than with the addition or augmented assignment operators. The partition() method is a useful and elegant string parsing tool, and the format() method provides a powerful means of replacing placeholders with stringified values. Range objects are immutable sequence types which represent arithmetic progressions of evenly spaced integer values. Range is sometimes used to generate counters in loops, although the enumerate() built-in function is often a superior alternative. Lists are the only mutable sequence type we have seen and are very widely used. Lists support indexing forward using positive or 0 integers and the indexing from the end with negative indices. The slice syntax allows us to copy all or part of a list. The full slice is a common Python idiom for copying lists, although the copy() method and the list() constructor are less obscure. List and other collection copies in Python are shallow copies. References are copied, but objects are not. Dictionaries are mapping types, which map from keys to values. The keys must be immutable objects whereas the values may be mutable. Iteration and membership testing with dictionaries is done with respect to the keys. The keys(), values(), and items() methods provide views onto the different aspects of a dictionary allowing convenient iteration. Sets store an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets support powerful set algebra operations and predicates. The built-in collections are organized according to which protocols they support such as iterable, sequence, and mapping. In passing we have also found out that underscore is in common usage used for dummy or superfluous variables and that the pprint module supports pretty printing of compound data structures. Well, that just about wraps it up for this module on Python's collections. Next time we'll look at exception handling so we can deal with those occasional value and key errors we've encountered, learn the error of our ways with respect to return codes, and see that it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission.

      "Hello. My name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the sixth module of the Python Fundamentals course where we introduce exception handling techniques. Exception handling is a mechanism for stopping normal program flow and continuing at some surrounding context or code block. The event of interrupting normal flow is called the act of raising an exception. In some enclosing context the raise exception must be handled upon which control flow if transferred to the exception handler. If an exception propagates up the call stack to the start of the program, then an unhandled exception will cause the program to terminate. And exception object containing information about where and why an exceptional event occurred is transported from the point at which the exception was raised to the exception handler so that the handler can interrogate the exception object and take appropriate action. If you've used exceptions in other popular imperative languages like C++ or Java, then you've already got a good idea of how exceptions work in Python. There have been long and tiresome debates over exactly what constitutes an exceptional event, the core issue being that exceptionality is in reality a matter of degree, some things are more exceptional than others, whereas programming languages impose a false dichotomy by insisting that an event is entirely exceptional or not at all exceptional. The Python philosophy is at the liberal end of the spectrum when it comes to the use of exceptions. Exceptions are ubiquitous in Python, and it's crucial to understand how to handle them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions and Control Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "Since exceptions are a means of control flow, they can be clumsy to demonstrate at the REPL, so for this part of the course we'll be using a Python module to contain our code. Let's start with a very simple module we can use for exploring these important concepts and behaviors. Place this code in a module called exceptional.py. Import the convert function from this module into the Python REPL and call our function with a string to see that it has the desired effect. But if we call our function with an object that can't be converted to an integer, we get a traceback from the int call. What's happened here is that the int constructor raised an exception because it couldn't sensibly perform the conversion. We didn't have a handler in place, so it was caught by the REPL and the stack trace was displayed. The ValueError referred to in the stack trace is the type of the exception object, and the error message invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hedgehog' is part of the payload of the exception object that has been retrieved and printed by the REPL. Notice the exception propagates across several levels in the call stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handling Exceptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's make our convert function more robust by handling the ValueError using a try except construct. Both the try and except keywords introduce new blocks. The try block contains code that could raise an exception, and the except block contains the code which performs error handling in the event that an exception is raised. We have decided that if a non-integer string is supplied we'll return -1. To reinforce your understanding of the control flow here, we'll add a couple of print statements. Modify the convert function to look like this. Let's test this interactively after restarting the REPL. (Typing) Note how the print in the try block after the point at which the exception was raised was not executed when we passed in giraffe. Instead, execution was transferred directly to the first statement of the except block. The int constructor only accepts numbers in strings, so let's see what happens if we feed an object of another type into it, say a list. This time our handler didn't intercept the exception. If we look closely at the trace, we can see that this time we receive a TypeError, a different type of exception. Each try block can have multiple corresponding except blocks, which intercept exceptions of different types. Let's add a handler for TypeError too. Now if we rerun the same test in a fresh REPL we find that TypeError is handled too. We've got some code duplication between our two exception handlers with that duplicated print statement and assignment. We'll move the assignment in front of the try block, which doesn't change the behavior of the program. Then we'll exploit the fact that both handlers did the same thing by collapsing them into one using the ability of the except statement to accept a tuple of exception types. Now we see that everything still works as designed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programmer Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we're confident with the control flow for exception behavior, we can remove the print statements. But now when we try to import our program, we get yet another type of exception, an IndentationError because our except block is now empty, and empty blocks are not permitted in Python programs. This is not an exception type that is ever useful to catch with an except block. Almost anything that goes wrong with the Python program results in an exception, but some such as IndentationError, SyntaxError, and NameError are the result of programmer errors, which should be identified and corrected during development rather than handled at runtime. The fact that these things are exceptions is mostly useful if you're creating a Python development tool such as a Python IDE, embedding Python itself in a larger system to support application scripting, or designing a plug-in system, which dynamically loads code. With that said, we still have the problem of what to do with our empty except block. The solution arrives in the form of the pass keyword, which is a special statement which does precisely nothing. It's a NOOP, and its only purpose is to allow us to construct syntactically permissible blocks which are semantically empty. Perhaps in this case though it would be better to simplify further and just use multiple return statements and do away with the X variable completely. Sometimes we'd like to get ahold of the exception object, in this case an object of type ValueError or TypeError and interrogate it for more details of what went wrong. We can get a named reference to the exception object by tacking an as clause onto the end of the except statement. We'll modify our function to print a message with exception details to the standard error stream before returning. To print a standard error, we need to get a reference to the stream from the sys module, so at the top of our module we'll need to import sys. We can then pass sys.stderr as a keyword argument called file to the print function. We take advantage of the fact that exception objects can be converted to strings using the str constructor. Now let's see that at the REPL.\n",

      "Imprudent Error Codes\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's add a second function string_log to our module, which calls our convert function and computes the natural log of the result. At this point we must confess that we've gone out of way here to be deeply unpythonic by wrapping the perfectly good int conversion included with Python, which raises exceptions on failure, in our convert function, which returns a good old fashioned negative error code. Rest assured that this unforgivable Python heresy has been committed solely to demonstrate the greatest folly of error return codes, that they can be ignored by the caller wreaking havoc amongst unsuspecting code later in the program. A slightly better program might test the value of V before proceeding to the log call. Without such a check, log will of course fail when passed the negative error code value. Naturally, the log failure causes the raising of another exception. Much better, and altogether more Pythonic, is to forget about error codes completely and go back to rasing an exception from convert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-Raising Exceptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of returning an unpythonic error code, we can simply omit our error message and re-raise the exception object we're currently handling. This can be done by replacing the return -1 with raise at the end of our exception handling block. Without a parameter, raise simply re-raises the exception that is being currently handled. Testing in the REPL, we can see that the original exception type is re-raised whether it's a ValueError or a TypeError, but our conversion error message has printed a standard error along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions as APIs\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions form an important aspect of the API of a function. Callers of a function need to know which exceptions to expect under various conditions so that they can ensure appropriate exception handlers are in place. We'll use a square root finding as an example using a home-grown square root function courtesy of Heron of Alexandria, although he probably didn't use Python. Place the following code in a file called roots.py. There's only one language feature in this program we haven't met before, the logical and operator, which we use in this case to test that two conditions are true on each iteration of the loop. Python also includes a logical or operator, which can be used to test whether either or both operands are true. Running our program, we can see that Heron was really onto something. Let's add a new line to the main() function, which takes the square root of -1. If we run that, we get a new exception. What has happened is that Python has intercepted a division by 0, which occurs on the second iteration of the loop and raises an exception, a ZeroDivisionError. Let's modify our code to catch the exception before it propagates up to the top of the call stack, thereby causing our program to stop using the try except construct. Now when we run the script we see that we're handling the exception cleanly. We should be careful to avoid a beginner's mistake of having two tight scopes for exception handling blocks. We can easily use one try except blocks for all of our calls to square root. We also need a third print statement to show how execution of the enclosed block is terminated. This is an improvement on what we started with, but most likely users of a square root function don't expect it to throw a ZeroDivisionError. Python provides us with several standard exception types to signal common errors. If a function parameter is supplied with an illegal value, it is customary to raise a ValueError. We can do this by using the raise keyword with a newly created exception object, which we can create by calling the ValueError constructor. There are two places we could deal with the division by zero. The first approach would be to wrap the root finding while loop in a try except ZeroDivisionError construct and then raise a new ValueError exception from inside the exception handler. This would be wasteful though. We know this routine will fail with negative numbers, so we can detect this free condition early on and raise an exception at that point. This is a simple if statement and a call to raise passing the new exception object. The ValueError constructor accepts an error message. See how we also modify the docstring to make it plain which exception type will be raised by a square root and under what circumstances. But look what happens if we run the program. We're still getting a traceback and an ungraceful program exit. This happens because we forgot to modify our exception handler to catch ValueError rather than ZeroDivisionError. Let's modify our calling code to catch the right exception class and also assign the caught exception object to a named variable so we can interrogate it after it has been caught. In this case, our interrogation is simply to print the exception object, which knows how to display itself as the message to standard error. Running the program again, we can see that our exception is being handled gracefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions, APIs, and Protocols\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, exceptions are part of a function's API, and more broadly they are part of certain protocols. For example, objects which implement the sequence protocol should raise and IndexError exception for indices which are out of range. The exceptions which are raised are as much a part of a function's specification as the arguments it accepts, and as such must be implemented and documented appropriately. There are a handful of common exception types in Python, and usually when you need to raise an exception in your own code one of the built-in types is a good choice. Much more rarely you'll need to define new exception types, but we don't cover that in this course. Often if you're deciding what exceptions your code should raise, you should look for similar cases in existing code. The more your code follows existing patterns, the easier it will be for people to integrate and understand. For example, suppose you are writing a key value database. It would be natural to use KeyError to indicate a request for a nonexistent key because this is how dictionary works. That is, mapping in Python follows certain patterns, and exceptions are part of that pattern. Let's look at a few common exception types. IndexError is raised when an integer index is out of range. You can see this when you index pass the end of a list. ValueError is raised when the object is of the right type, but contains an inappropriate value. We've seen that already when trying to construct an int from a non-numeric string. KeyError is raised when a look-up in a mapping fails. You can see that here when we look up a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do Not Guard Against Type Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "We tend to not protect against TypeErrors in Python. To do so runs against the grain of dynamic typing in Python and limits the reuse potential of the code that we write. For example, we could test whether an argument was an int using the built-in isinstance function and raise a TypeError exception if it was not, but then we'd also want to allow arguments that are instances of float as well. It soon gets complicated if we want to check whether our function will work with types such as rational, complex, or any other kind of number. And in any case, who's to say that it does? Alternatively, we could intercept TypeError inside our square root function and re-raise it, but to what end? Usually in Python it's not worth adding type checking to your functions. If a function works with a particular type, even one you couldn't have known about when you designed your function, then that's all to the good. If not, execution will probably result in a TypeError anyway. Likewise, we tend to not catch TypeErrors very frequently either.\n",
      "\n",
      "EAFP vs. LBYL\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's look at another tenant of Python philosophy and culture, the idea that it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. There are only two approaches to dealing with a program operation that might fail. The first approach is to check that all the preconditions for a failure-prone operation are met in advance of attempting the operation. The second approach is to blindly hope for the best, but be prepared to deal with the consequences if it doesn't work out. In Python culture, these two philosophies are known as Look Before You Leap, LBYL, and It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission, EAFP, which incidentally was coined by Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, inventor of the compiler. Python is strongly in favor of EAFP because it puts primary logic for the happy path in its most readable form with deviations from the normal flow handled separately rather than interspersed with the main flow. Let's consider an example, processing a file. The details of the processing aren't relevant. All we need to know is that the process_file function will open a file and read some data from it. First the LBYL version. Before attempting to call process_file, we check that the files exists, and if it doesn't we avoid making the call and print a helpful message instead. There are several problems with this approach, some obvious and some insidious. One obvious problem is that we only perform an existence check. What if the file exists, but contains garbage? What if the path refers to a directory instead of a file? According to LBYL, we should add preemptive tests for these too. A more subtle problem is that there is a race condition here. It's possible for the file to be deleted, for example by another process, between the existence check and the process_file call, a classic atomicity issue. There's really no good way to deal with this. Handling of errors from process_file will be needed in any case. Now consider the alternative using the more Pythonic EAFP approach. Here we simply attempt the operation without checks in advance, but we have an exception handler in place to deal with any problems. We don't even need to know in a lot of detail exactly what might go wrong. Here we catch OSError, which covers all manner of conditions such as file not found and using directories where files are expected. EAFP is standard in Python, and that philosophy is enabled by exceptions. Without exceptions, that is using error codes instead, you are forced to include error handling directly in the main flow of the logic. Since exceptions interrupt the main flow, they allow you to handle exceptional cases non-locally. Exceptions coupled with EAFP are also superior because unlike error codes exceptions cannot be easily ignored. By default, exceptions have a big effect whereas error codes are silent by default, so the exception EAFP- base style makes it very difficult for problems to be silently ignored.\n",

      "Clean-Up Actions\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you need to perform a cleanup action irrespective of whether an operation succeeds. In a later module we'll introduce context managers, which are the modern solution to this common situation, but here we'll introduce the try…finally construct since creating a context manager can be overkill in simple cases. And in any case, an understanding of try…finally is useful for making your own context managers. Consider this function, which uses various facilities of the Standard Library's OS module to change the current working directory, create a new directory at that location, and then restore to the original working directory. At first sight this seems reasonable, but should the call to os.mkdir fail for some reason, the current working directory of the Python process won't be restored to its original value, and the make_at function will have had an unintended side effect. To fix this, we'd like the function to restore the original current working directory under all circumstances. We can achieve this with a try…finally block. Code in the finally-block is executed whether execution leaves the try-block normally by reaching the end of the block or exceptionally by an exception being raised. This construct can be combined with except blocks, here used to add a simple further logging facility. Now if the os.mkdir call raises an OSError, the OS handler will be run, and the exception will be re-raised. But since the finally block is always run no matter how the try block ends, we can be sure that the final directory change will take place in all circumstances.\n",

      "Detecting a single keypress from Python such as the press any key to continue functionality at the console requires use of operating system specific modules. We can't use the built-in input function because that waits for the user to press Return before giving us a string. To implement this on Windows, we need to use functionality from the Windows only msvcrt module, and on Linux and Mac OS X we need to use functionality from the Unix only tty and termios modules in addition to the sys module. This example is quite instructive as it demonstrates many Python language features including import and def as statements as opposed to declarations. Recall the top level module code is executed on first import. Within the first try block we attempt to import msvcrt, the Microsoft Visual C runtime. If this succeeds, we then proceed to define a function getkey(), which delegates to the msvcrt.getch() function. Even though we are inside a try block at this point, the function will be declared at the current scope, which is the module scope. If, however, the import of msvcrt fails because we're not running on Windows, an ImportError will be raised, and execution will transfer to the except block. This is a case of an error being silenced explicitly because we're going to attempt an alternative course of action in the exception handler. Within the except block we import three modules needed for a getkey() implementation on Unix-like systems, and then proceed to the alternative definition of getkey(), which again binds the function implementation to a name in the module scope. This Unix implementation of getkey() uses a try…finally construct to restore various terminal attributes after the terminal has been put into raw mode for the purposes of reading a single character. In the event that our program is running on neither Windows nor a Unix-like system, the import tty statement will raise a second import error. This time we make no attempt to intercept this exception. We allow it to propagate to our caller, which is whatever attempted to import this keypress module. We know how to signal this error, but not how to handle it, so we defer that decision to our caller. The error will not pass silently. If the caller has more knowledge or alternative tactics available, it can in turn intercept this exception and take appropriate action, perhaps degrading to using Python's input built-in function and giving a different message to the user.\n",

      "\n",
      "We've tackled a complicated subject in this module, so let's see if we can sum up. The raising of an exception interrupts normal program flow and transfers control to an exception handler. Exception handlers are defined using the try…except construct. Try blocks define a context in which exceptions can be detected. Corresponding except blocks define handlers for specific types of exceptions. Python uses exceptions pervasively, and many built-in language features depend on them. Except blocks can capture an exception object, which is often of a standard type such as a ValueError, KeyError, or IndexError. Programmer errors such as indentation error and syntax error should not normally be handled. Exceptional conditions can be signaled using the raise keyword, which accepts a single parameter of an exception object. Raise without an argument with an except block re-raises the exception which is currently being processed. We tend to not to routinely check for TypeErrors. To do so would negate the flexibility afforded to us by Python's dynamic type system. Exception objects can be converted to strings using the str() constructor for the purposes of printing message payloads. The exceptions thrown by a function form part of its API and should be appropriately documented. When raising exceptions, prefer to use the most appropriate built-in exception type. Cleanup and restorative actions can be performed using the try…finally construct, which may optionally be used in conjunction with except blocks. Along the way, we saw that the output of the print() function can be directed to standard error using the optional file argument. Python supports the logical operators and and or for combining boolean expressions. Return codes are too easily ignored. Platform-specific actions can be implemented using an easier to ask forgiveness than permission approach facilitated by intercepting import errors and providing alternative implementations.

      "\n",
      "Comprehensions in Python are a concise syntax for describing lists, sets, or dictionaries in a declarative or functional style. This shorthand is readable and expressive meaning that comprehensions are very effective at communicating intent to human readers. Some comprehensions almost read like natural language making them nicely self-documenting. Let's start with list comprehensions. Comprehensions are much easier to demonstrate than they are to explain, so let's bring up a Python REPL. First we'll create a list of words, \"Why sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast,\" by splitting a string. Now comes the list comprehension. The comprehension is enclosed in square brackets just like a literal list, but instead of literal elements it contains a fragment of declarative code, which describes how to construct the elements of the list. Here the new list is formed by binding word to each value in words in turn and evaluating len(word) to create a new value. The general form of list comprehensions is expression of item for item in iterable. That is, for each item in the iterable object on the right, we evaluate the expression on the left, which is almost always, but not necessarily in terms of the item and use that as the next element of this new list. This comprehension is the declarative equivalent of the following imperative code, which uses a for loop and the list to accumulate the lengths found so far. Notice that the source object over which we iterate doesn't need to be a list. It can be any iterable object such as a tuple. The expression which is in terms of the item can be any Python expression. Here we find the number of decimal digits in each of the first 20 factorials using the range function to generate the source sequence. Note also that the type of object produced by list comprehensions is nothing more or less than a regular list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set Comprehensions\n",
      "\n",
      "Set support is similar comprehension syntax using, as you might expect, curly braces instead of square brackets, and number of digits in factorial's result contain duplicates. By building a set instead, we can eliminate them, although note that the resulting set is not necessarily stored in a meaningful order since sets are unordered containers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
      "\n",
      "The third type of comprehension is the dictionary comprehension. This also uses curly braces and is distinguished from the set comprehension by the fact that we now provide two colon separated expressions for the key and value, which will be evaluated in tandem for each item. Here's a dictionary we can play with, which maps countries to their capital cities, the U.K. to London, Brazil to Brazilia, Morocco to Rabat, and Sweden to Stockholm. One nice use for a dictionary comprehension is to invert a dictionary so we can perform efficient lookups in the opposite direction. This example converts from a capital to country mapping into a country to capital mapping. Note that dictionary comprehension is to not usually operate dictionary on sources while they can, but recall that iterating over a dictionary yields only the keys. If we want both the keys and the values, we should use the items() method of the dictionary, and then use tuple unpacking to access the key and values separately. Should your comprehension produce some identical keys, later keys will override earlier keys. In this example we map the first letters of words to the words themselves, but only the last H word is kept. Remember that there's no limit to the complexity of the expression you can use in any of the comprehensions, but for the sake of your fellow programmers you should avoid going overboard and extract complex expressions into separate functions to preserve readability. The following is close to the limit of being reasonable for a dictionary comprehension. It uses the Standard Library glob module to find all of the Python source files in a particular directory, and then creates a mapping from the full path name for those files to the size of the file in bytes. The file path and file size are derived using facilities of the OS module.\n",

All three types of collection comprehension support an optional filtering clause, which allows us to choose which items of the source are evaluated by the expression on the left. We can use our new is_prime function as the filtering clause of a list comprehension to produce all the primes less than 100 with the numbers up to and including 100 being produced by a call to the range constructor. We have a slightly odd looking X for X construct here because we're not applying any transformation to the filtered values. The expression in terms of X is simply X itself. There's nothing to stop us combining a filtering predicate with a transforming expression. Here's a dictionary comprehension, which maps numbers with exactly three divisors to a tuple of those divisors.\n",

There's no hard and fast rule about when one form should be preferred, but be conscientious when writing your code, and try to choose the best form for your situation. Above all, your comprehension should ideally be purely functional. That is, they should have no side effects. If you need to create side effects such as printing to the console during iteration, use another construct such as a for loop instead.\n",

      "Iteration Protocols\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensions and for loops are the most frequently used language features for performing iteration. That is, taking items one-by-one from a source and doing something with each in turn. However, both comprehensions and for loops iterate over the whole sequence by default whereas sometimes more fine-grain control is needed. There are two important concepts here on which a great deal of Python language behavior is constructed, iterable objects and iterator objects, both of which are reflected in standard Python protocols. The iterable protocol allows us to pass an iterable object, usually a collection or stream of objects such as a list, to the built-in iter() function to get an iterator for the iterable object. Iterator objects support the iterator protocol, which requires that we can pass the iterator object to the built-in next() function to fetch the next value from the underlying collection. As usual, a demonstration at the Python REPL will help all these concepts crystalize into something you can work with. We'll use a list of the names of the seasons, in British-English no less, as our iterable source object. We ask our iterable object to give us an iterator using the built-in iter function, and then request a value from the iterator using the next function. Each call to next moves the iterator through the sequence returning Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. But what happens when we reach the end? In a spectacular display of Python's liberal attitude to errors, Python raises an exception, specifically of the type StopIteration. Those of you coming from other programming languages with a more straight-laced approach to exceptions may find this mildly outrageous, but I ask you what could be more exceptional than reaching the end of a collection? It only has one end after all. This attempt at rationalizing the language design decision makes even more sense when one considers that the iterable series may be a potentially infinite stream of data. Reaching the end in that case really would be something to write home about or indeed raise an exception for. With for loops and comprehensions at our fingertips, the utility of these lower-level iteration protocols may not be obvious. To demonstrate a more concrete use, here's a little utility function, which when passed an iterable object returns the first item from that series, or if the series is empty raises a ValueError. This works as expected on any iterable object, in this case demonstrated on both a list and a set. It's worth noting that the higher-level iteration constructs such as for loops and comprehensions are built directly upon this lower-level iteration protocol.\n",

      "Generators\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we come onto generator functions, one of the most powerful and elegant features of the Python programming language. Python generators provide the means for describing iterable series with code and functions. These sequences are evaluated lazily meaning they only compute the next value on demand. This important property allows them to model infinite sequences of values with no definite end such as streams of data from a sensor or active log files. By carefully designing our generator functions, we can make generic stream processing elements, which can be composed into sophisticated pipelines. Generators are defined by any Python function which uses the yield keyword at least once in its definition. They may also contain the return keyword with no arguments. And just like any other function, there's an implicit return at the end of the definition. To understand what generators do, let's start with a simple example at the Python REPL. We'll define the generator, and then we'll examine how the generator works. Here we write a generator called gen123(), which yields successively 1, 2, and 3. The generator function is introduced by def just as a regular Python function, and as we've seen, we must use the yield keyword at least once within the definition. Here I'm yielding a value of 1, and then 2, and then 3. We'll enter a blank line to complete the definition, and there we are. Now let's call gen123() and assign its return value to G. As you can see, gen123() is called just like any other Python function, but what has it returned? G is a generator object. Generators are in fact Python iterators, so we can use the standard ways of working with iterators to retrieve or yield successive values from the sequence. To retrieve the next value from an iterator, we use the built- in next function passing the iterator or generator in this case to the function. So, next(g) returns 1, and again 2, and again 3. Take note of what happens now that we've yielded the last value from our generator. Subsequent calls to next raise a StopIteration exception just like any other Python iterator. Because generators are iterators, they can be used in all the usual Python constructs which expect iterators such as for loops. Here we call the generator again, and in each iteration of the loop we print the return value 1, 2, 3 just as we'd expect. Be aware that each call to the generator function returns a new generator object. Here we call gen123() again assigning to H, and again assigning to I. We can see when we display these objects that they have distinct addresses. This means that each generator can be advanced independently. Let's request the first value from H, the second value from H, and now the first value from I. Let's take a closer look at how and crucially when the code in the body of our generator function is executed. To do this, we'll create a slightly more complex generator that traces its execution with good old-fashioned print statements. As we enter the generator, we'll print a message. Then we will yield 2 and print a message about yielding 4, and then yield 4, print a message about yielding 6, and then yield 6. And then at the generator function we'll print a message indicating that the function is about to return. A blank line to complete the definition, and now we can call our new generator assigning to G. Note that at this point the generator object has been created and returned, but none of the code within the generator body has yet been executed. Now let's call the built-in next function on our generator. See how when we request the first value the generator body runs up to and including the first yield statement. The code executes just far enough to literally yield the next value. When we call next(g) again, execution of the generator function resumes at the point it left off and continues running until the next yield. And then the final value. The function resumes again until it yields 6. After the final value is returned, the next request causes the generator function to execute until it returns at the end of the function body, which in turn raises the expected StopIteration exception.\n",

      "Stateful Generator Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we'll look at how our generator functions, which resume execution each time the next value is requested, can maintain state in local variables. In the process of doing so, our generators will be both more interesting and useful. The resumable nature of generator functions can result in complex control flow, so we'll be watching the execution of these generators in a graphical Python debugger. I'll be using PyCharm, but you can use any Python debugger to trace generator execution. We'll be showing two generators which demonstrate lazy evaluation, which will then combine into a generator pipeline. The first generator we'll look at is called take, which retrieves a specified number of elements from the front of a sequence. Note that the function defines a generator because it contains at least one yield statement. This particular generator also contains a return statement to terminate the stream of yielded values. The generator simply uses a counter to keep track of how many elements have been yielded so far ending the sequence when we reach a specified count. Since generators are lazy and only produce values on request, we'll drive execution with a for loop and a run_take function. In run_take we create a source list called items, which we pass to our generator function along with a count of 3. Internally the for loop will use the iterator protocol to retrieve values from the take generator until it terminates. Once execution begins, the for loop in run_take requests a value from take, which runs until it encounters the yield statement. At this point control returns to run_take, which prints the value until we get to the next iteration of what is in effect the outer for loop. Each iteration of the outer loop causes execution to be transferred back into run_take just sufficiently to yield the next value. Eventually the counter variable is equal to the counter argument and will literally return from run_take. Behind the scenes this raises a StopIteration exception, which is caught by the internal machinery of the for loop in run_take. This is the signal that take has done its work, so the for loop exits, and the program completes. Now let's bring our second generator into the picture. This generator function called distinct eliminates duplicate items by keeping track of which elements it's already seen in a set. In this generator we also make use of a control flow construct we have not previously seen, the continue keyword. The continue statement finishes the current iteration of the loop and begins the next iteration immediately. When executed in this case, execution will be transferred back to the for statement, but as with break it can also be used with while loops. In this case, the continue is used to skip any values which have already been yielded. As execution starts, the for loop and run_distinct() request a value from distinct. This runs until it reaches yield, which on this iteration simply returns the first item retrieved by this inner for loop form the items list. Control flow transfers to run_distinct, which prints the value and proceeds with its next iteration. Note how when execution of distinct resumes we actually complete the work of the previous iteration by remembering the value just yielded before getting on with the most recently requested value. We can do this because item is not reassigned until we get back to the for statement. On the third iteration, the next item retrieved from the source is already present in the seen set. Control enters the if block, and the continue statement is executed transferring control back to the beginning of the innermost loop. Eventually the items list is exhausted. The generator returns implicitly at the end, the for loop and run_distinct completes, and the program exits. Now we'll arrange both of our generators into a lazy pipeline using take and distinct together to fetch the first three unique items from a collection. A coherent verbal description of step-by-step execution of a generator pipeline may not even be possible, but that's not going to stop us trying. When execution starts, distinct must be called first in order to produce the argument for take. Of course distinct returns the generator object over which take will be iterating. In turn, the generator object returned by take will be iterated over by the for loop in our run_pipline driver function. This part of the process is hidden from the view of the debugger. When the outermost loop in run_pipeline requests its first value, execution is transferred to take. Remember, the iterable over which take is looping is the generator produced by distinct. When the for loop and take request the first value from this generator, control is transferred to distinct. Distinct now runs until it reaches the yield at which point it is returning the first item from the source list, 3. The value is yielded back to the for loop intake, which executes until it in turn yields the value back to the loop in run_pipeline, which only now starts its first iteration printing the first value. Execution continues in this interleaved manner until the first three distinct values have been yielded and printed. The advantage of this approach is that distinct only does just enough work to yield the first three distinct values rather than processing its whole source list. It pays to be lazy.\n",

      "Laziness and the Infinite. Generators are lazy meaning that computation only happens just in time when the next result is requested. This interesting and useful property of generators means that they can be used to model infinite sequences. Since values are only produced as requested by the caller and since no data structure needs to be built to contain the elements of the sequence, generators can safely be used to produce never ending or just very large sequences like sensor readings, mathematical sequences such as primes or factorials, or perhaps the contents of multi-terabyte files. The authors of this course are sworn by sacred oath never to use either Fibonacci or quick sort implementations in demonstrations or exercises. Allow us to present the function for the lucas() series, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the order in which you should watch the episodes of Star Wars. The lucas() series starts with 2 and 1, and each value after that is the sum of the two preceding values. So, the first few values of the sequence are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 11. The first yield produces the value 2. The function then initializes A and B, which hold the previous two values needed as the function proceeds. Then the function enters an infinite while loop where first it yields the value of B, and then second A and B are updated to hold the new previous two values using a neat application of tuple unpacking. Now that we have the lucas() generator, it can be used like any other iterable object. For instance, to print the lucas numbers you could use a loop like this: For x in lucas() print (x). Of course since the lucas sequence is infinite, this will run forever printing out values until your computer runs out of memory. Use Control+C to terminate the loop.\n",

      "Generator expressions are a cross between comprehensions and generator functions. They use a similar syntax as comprehensions, but they result in the creation of a generator object, which produces the specified sequence lazily. The syntax for generator expressions is very similar to list comprehensions, the expression of item for item in iterable delimited by parentheses instead of the brackets used for list comprehensions. Generator expressions are useful for situations where you want the lazy evaluation of generators with the declarative concision of comprehensions. For example, this generator expression yields a list of the first one million square numbers. At this point, none of the squares have been created. We've just captured the specification of the sequence into a generator object. We can force evaluation of the generator by using it to create a long list. This list obviously consumes a significant chunk of memory, in this case about 40 megabytes for the list object and the integer contained therein. Also notice that a generator object is just an interator and once run exhaustively in this way will yield no more items. Repeating the previous statement returns an empty list. Generators are single-use objects. Each time we call a generator function, we create a new generator object. To recreate a generator from a generator expression, we must execute the expression itself once more. Let's raise the stakes by computing the sum of the first 10 million squares using the built-in sum function, which accepts an interable series of numbers. If we were to use a list comprehension, we could expect this to consume around 400 megabytes of memory. Using a generator expression, memory usage will be insignificant. This produces a result in a second or so and uses almost no memory. Looking carefully, you'll seen that in this case we didn't supply separate enclosing parentheses for the generator expression in addition to those needed for the sum function call. This elegant ability to have the parentheses used for the function call also serve for the generator expression aids readability. You can include the second set of parentheses if you wish, but it's not required. As with comprehensions, you can include an if clause at the end of the generator expression. Reusing an admittedly inefficient is_prime predicate, we can determine the sum of those integers from the first 1000, which are prime, like this.\n",

      "Batteries Included for Iteration\n",
      "\n",
      "So far we've covered the many ways Python offers for creating iterable objects. Comprehensions, generators, and any object that follows the iterable or iterator protocols can be used for iteration, so it should be clear that iteration is a central feature of Python. Python provides a number of built-in functions for performing common iterator operations. These functions form the call of a sort of vocabulary for working with iterators, and they can be combined to produce powerful statements in very concise, readable code. We've met some of these functions already including enumerate for producing integer indices and sum for computing summation of numbers. In addition to the built-in functions, the itertools module contains a wealth of useful functions and generators for processing iterable streams of data. We'll start demonstrating these functions by solving the first thousand primes problem using the built-in sum function with two generator functions from itertools, islice() and count(). Earlier we made our own take generator function for lazily retrieving the start of a sequence. We needn't have bothered, however, because islice allows us to perform lazy slicing similar to the built-in list slicing functionality. Once we've imported the itertools module, to get the first 1000 primes we need to do something like this. Itertools.islice(all_primes, 1000). But how to generate all_primes? Previously we've been using range to create the raw sequences of integers to feed into our primality test, but ranges must always be finite, that is banded at both ends. What we'd like is an open-ended version of range, and that is exactly what itertools count() provides. This returns a special islice object, which is iterable. We can covert it to a list using the list constructor. Answering our question about the sum of the first 1000 primes is now easy so long as we remember to recreate the generator when we pass it to sum. The answer is 3,682,913. Two other very useful built-ins which facilitate elegant programs are any and all. They're equivalent to the logical operators and or, but for iterable series of bool values. Any returns true of any of the series it's passed are true, and all returns true if all of the series passed to it are true. Here we use any together with a generator expression to answer the question of whether there are any prime numbers in the range 1328 to 1360 inclusive, and remarkably the answer is false. For a completely different type of problem, we can check that all of the city names are proper nouns with initial uppercase letters. The last built-in we'll look at is zip, which as its name suggests gives us a way to synchronize iterations over two iterable series. For example, if we have two columns of temperature data, one from Sunday and one from Monday, we can combine them together into pairs of corresponding readings. We can see that zip yields tuples when iterated. This in turn means we can use it with tuple unpacking in the for loop. In fact, zip can accept any number of iterable arguments. Let's add a third time series and use other built-ins to calculate statistics for corresponding times. Here we use the min and max built-ins for the minimum and maximum temperatures and the sum and len built-ins to compute the average temperature. Perhaps though we'd like one long temperature series for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. We can then lazily concatenate iterables using itertools chain, so this is different from simply concatenating the three lists into a new list. We can now check that all of those temperatures are above freezing point without the memory impact of data duplication. Before we summarize, we'd like to pull a few pieces of what we have made together and leave your computer computing the lucas primes. This shows the beautiful composability of generator functions, generator expressions, pure predicate functions, and for loops. When you've seen enough or broken some records, we recommend you spend some time exploring the itertools module.\n",

      "In this module we've covered the techniques that we'll run through some of the most elegant Python code you'll produce. Let's recap what we've learned. Comprehensions are a concise and readable syntax for describing lists, sets, and dictionaries in a declarative way. These comprehensions iterate on an iterable source object and apply an optional predicate filter and a mandatory expression. Both filter and expression are usually in terms of the current item. Iterable objects are objects over which we can iterate item-by-item. We retrieve an iterate all from an iterable using the built-in iter() function. Iterators produce items one-by-one from the underlying iterable series each time they are passed to the built-in next() function. When the series is exhausted, iterators raise a StopIteration exception. Generator functions allow us to describe sequences using imperative code. Generator functions look just like regular functions and have all the same facilities, but they must contain at least one instance of the yield keyword. The generator is produced when you call a generator function are iterators. When the iterator is advanced with next(), the generator starts or resumes execution up to and including the next yield statement. Although generators can't be reused, generator functions can. Each call to a generator function creates a new generator object. Generators can maintain state between calls in local variables and because they are lazy can model infinite series of data. Generator expressions are a sort of hybrid of generator functions and list comprehensions. These allow for a more declarative and concise way of creating generator objects. Python includes a rich set of tools for dealing with iterable series both in the form of built-in functions such as sum(), any(), and zip(), but also in the itertools module. We've given you some powerful tools in this module for writing functional style programs. In the next module we'll experience a paradigm shift as we get to grips with object-oriented programming with classes. See you there.\n",

      "Hello. My name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the eighth module of the Python Fundamentals course. Here we'll cover classes, Python's tools for creating new types. You can get a long way in Python using the built-in scaler and collection types. For many problems, the built-in types and those available in the Python Standard library are completely sufficient. Sometimes though they aren't quite what's required, and the ability to create custom types is where classes come in. As we've seen, all objects in Python have a type, and when we report that type using the type built-in function, the result is couched in terms of class. Classes are a means of defining the structure and behavior of objects at the time we create the object. Generally speaking, the type of an object is fixed throughout its lifetime. As such, classes act as a sort of template or pattern according to which new objects are constructed. The class of an object controls its initialization in which attributes and methods are available through the object. For example, on a string object the methods we can use on that object such as split are defined in the str class. Classes are a key piece of machinery for object-oriented programming, and although it's often true that OOP is useful for making complex problems more tractable, it also commonly has the effect of making the solution to simple problems unnecessarily complex. A great thing about Python is that it's highly object oriented without forcing you to deal with classes until you really need them. This sets the language starkly apart from Java and C#.\n",

      "Defining Classes\n",
      "\n",
      "Python gives us the tools to define new classes, which can be completely novel or based on existing classes. Class definitions are introduced by the class keyword followed by the class name. By convention, the new class name in Python uses CamelCase, sometimes known as PascalCase with a capital letter for each and every component word. Since classes are awkward to define at the REPL, we'll be using a Python module file to hold our class definitions. Let's start with the very simplest class to which we'll progressively add features. For this module I'll be using the PyCharm Python IDE so that it's easy to follow the code examples and their use in the REPL. In this example we'll model a passenger aircraft flight between two airports by putting this code into airtravel.py. The class statement introduces a new block, so we indent on the next line. Empty blocks aren't allowed, so the simplest possible class needs at least a do nothing pass statement to be syntactially admissible. Just as with def for defining functions, class is a statement that can occur anywhere in a program and which binds a class definition to a class name. When the top level code in the airtravel module is executed, the class will be defined. We can now import our new class into the REPL and try it out. The thing we've just imported is the class object. Everything is an object in Python, and classes are no exception. To use this class to mint a new object, we call its constructor, which is done by calling the class as we would a function. The constructor returns a new object, which here we assign to a name F. If we use the type function to request the type of F, we see that it's of class 'airtravel.Flight.' The type of F literally is the class.\n",

      "Instance Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's make our class a little more interesting by adding a so-called instance method, which returns the flight number. Methods are just functions defined within the class, and instance methods are functions which can be called on objects or instances of our class such as F. Instance methods must accept a reference to the instance on which the method was called as the first argument, and by convention this argument is always called self. We have no way of configuring the flight number value yet, so we'll just return a constant string. Now from a fresh REPL let's import that and see how it works. Notice that when we call the method we do not provide the instance F for the actual argument itself in the argument list. That's because the standard method invocation form with the dot is simply syntactic sugar for the class name followed by a dot followed by the method name with the instance passed as the first argument. If you try the latter, you'll find that it works as expected, although you'll almost never see this form used for real.\n",

      "Initializers\n",
      "\n",
      "This class isn't very useful because it can only represent one particular flight. We need to make the flight number configurable at the point that flight is created. To do that, we need to write an initialization method. If provided, the initialization method is called as part of the process of creating a new object when we call the constructor. The initializer method must be called to double underscore init delimited by the double underscores used for Python runtime machinery. Like all other instance methods, the first argument to double underscore init must be self. In this case, we also pass a second argument to double underscore init, which is the flight number. The initializer should not return anything. It simply modifies the object referred to by self. If you're coming from a Java, C#, or C++ background, it's tempting to think of double underscore init as being the constructor. This isn't quite accurate. In Python, the purpose of double underscore init is to configure an object that already exists by the time it's called. The self argument is, however, analogous to this in Java, C#, or C++. In Python, the actual constructor is provided by the Python runtime system, and one of the things it does is check for the existence of an instance initializer and call it when present. Within the initializer we assign to an attribute of the newly created instance called _number. Assigning to an object attribute that doesn't yet exist is sufficient to bring it into being. Just as we don't need to declare variables until we create them, neither do we need to declare object attributes before we create them. We choose _number with the leading underscore for two reasons. First, because it avoids a name clash with the method of the same name. Methods are functions, functions are objects, and these functions are bound to attributes of the object, so we already have an attribute called number, and we don't want to replace it. Second, there is a widely followed convention that the implementation details of objects which are not intended for consumption or manipulation by clients of the object should be prefixed with an underscore. We also modify our number method to access the _number attribute and return it. Any arguments passed to the flight constructor will be forwarded to the initializer. So, to create and configure our flight object we can now do this. We can also directly access the implementation details. Although this is not recommend for production code, it's very handy for debugging and early testing. If you're coming from a bondage and discipline language like Java or C# with public, private, and protected access modifiers, Python's everything is public approach can seem excessively open minded. The prevailing culture among Pythonistas is that we're all consenting adults here. In practice, the leading underscore convention has proven sufficient protection even in large and complex Python systems we have worked with. People know not to use these attributes directly, and in fact they tend not to. Like so many doctrines, lack of access modifiers is a much bigger problem in theory than in practice. It's good practice for the initializer of an object to establish so-called class invariants. The invariants are truths about the objects of that class that should endure for the lifetime of the object. One such invariant for flights is that the flight number always begins with an uppercase two letter airline code followed by a three or four digit route number. In Python we establish class invariants in the double underscore init method and raise exceptions if they can't be attained. We use string slicing and various methods of the string class to perform validation. For the first time in the course we also see the logical negation operator not. Ad hoc testing in the REPL is a very effective technique during development. If we construct a flight with a valid flight number, everything works as expected. However, if that flight number doesn't have an airline code, we get a ValueError. Likewise, if the airline code is lowercase, we get a ValueError, and if we construct a flight that has letters instead of numbers you get another ValueError. And if we try to use five numbers instead of four, we also get a ValueError. Now that we're sure of having a valid flight number, we'll add a second method to return just the airline code. Once the class invariants have been established, most query methods can be very simple.\n",

      "One of the things we'd like to do with our flight is accept seat bookings. To do that, we need to know the seating layout, and for that we need to know the type of aircraft. Let's make another class to model different kinds of aircraft. The initializer creates four attributes for the aircraft: Registration number, a model name, the number of rows of seats, and the number of seats per row. In a production code scenario we would validate these arguments to ensure for example that the number of rows was not negative. This is straightforward enough, but for the seating plan we'd like something a little more inline with our booking system. Rows in aircraft are numbered from 1, and the seats within each row are designated with letters from an alphabet which omits I to avoid confusion with 1. We'll add a seating plan method, which returns the allowed rows and seats as tuples containing a range object and a string of seat letters. It's worth pausing for a second to make sure you understand how this function works. The range call produces an iterable sequence of row numbers up to the number of rows in the plane. The string and its slice method return a string with one character per row. These two objects, the range and the string, are bundled up into a tuple. With that in mind, let's construct a plane. See how we use keyword arguments for the rows and seats for documentary purposes. Also recall that ranges are half open, so 23 is intentionally one beyond the end of the range.\n",

This method will delegate to aircraft on behalf of the client rather than allowing the client to reach through the flight and interrogate the aircraft object directly. We also add a docstring to the class. These work just like function and module docstrings. We can now construct a flight with a specific aircraft.

      "Example: Booking Seats\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we can proceed with implementing a simple booking system. For each flight we simply need to keep track of who is sitting in each seat. We'll represent the seat allocations using a list of dictionaries. The list will contain one entry for each seat row, and each entry will be a dictionary from seat letter to occupant name. If the seat is unoccupied, it will contain None. We initialize the seating plan in the flight initializer using this fragment. In the first line we retrieve the seating plan for the aircraft and use tuple unpacking to put the row and seat identifiers into local variables. In the second line we create a list for the seat allocations. Rather than continually deal with the fact that row indices are one-based whereas Python lists are zero- based, we choose to waste one entry at the beginning of the list. This first wasted entry is the single element list containing None. To this single element list we concatenate another list containing one entry for each real row in the aircraft. This list is constructed by a list comprehension which iterates over the rows object, which is the range of row numbers retrieved from the aircraft in the previous line. We're not actually interested in the row number since we know it will match up with the list index in the final index, so we discard it by using the dummy underscore variable. The item expression part of the list comprehension is itself a comprehension, specifically a dictionary comprehension. This iterates over each letter for the row and creates a mapping from the single character string to None to indicate an empty seat. We use a list comprehension rather than list replication with the multiplication operator because we want a distinct dictionary object to be created for each row. Here's the code after we put it into the initializer. Before we go further, let's test our code in the REPL. Thanks to the fact that everything is public, we can access implementation details during development, and it's clear enough that we're doing so since the leading underscores remind us what's public and what's not. That's accurate, but not particularly beautiful. Let's try again with pretty print. Perfect. Now we'll add behavior to flight to allocate seats to passengers. To keep this simple, a passenger will simply be a string name. Most of this code is validation of the seat designator and contains some interesting snippets. Methods are functions so deserve docstrings too. We get the seat letter by using negative indexing into the seat string. We test that the seat letter is valid by checking for membership of seat letters using the in membership testing operator. We extract the row number using string slicing to take all but the last character. We try to convert the row number substring to an integer using the int constructor. If this fails, we catch the ValueError and in the handler raise a new ValueError with a more appropriate message payload. We conveniently validate the row number by using the in operator against the rows object, which is a range. We can do this because range objects support the container protocol. We check that the requested seat is unoccupied using an identity test with None. If it's occupied, we raise a ValueError. If we get this far, everything is in good shape, and we can assign the seat. It also contains a bug, but we'll discover that soon enough. Let's try our seat allocator at the REPL. Doing so, we see that we get a TypeError in allocate_seat. Early on in your object-oriented Python career you're likely to see TypeError messages like this quite often. The problem has occurred because we forgot to include the self argument in the definition of the allocate_seat method. Once we fix that, we can try again. If we create our flight object as normal, we then allocate_seat 12A, but if we try to allocate_seat 12A a second time we get a ValueError. Now we allocate 15F and 15E, but if we try to allocate E27 we get a ValueError because E27 is obviously not a seat. We now allocate 1C and 1D, but if we try to seat Larry Wall in seat DD we get yet another ValueError because of course DD is not a valid seat. After that we pretty print to see how things look. The Dutchman is quite lonely there in row 12, so we'd like to move him back to row 15 with the Danes. To do so, we'll need a relocate passenger method.\n",

      "Defining Implementation Details\n",
      "\n",
      "First we'll perform a small refactoring and extract the seat designator, parsing, and validation logic into its own method parse_seat. We use a leading underscore here because this method is an implementation detail. The new parse_seat method returns a tuple with an integer row number and a seat letter string. This leave allocate_seat much simpler. See the call to parse_seat, and notice that method calls within the same object also require explicit qualification with the self prefix. Now we've laid the groundwork for our relocate_passenger method. This parses and validates the from_seat and to_seat arguments and then moves the passenger to the new location. It's also getting tiresome recreating the flight object each time, so we'll add a module level convenience function for that too. It's quite normal to mix related functions and classes in the same module. Now let's see that at the REPL. You may find it remarkable that we have access to the flight class when we have only imported a function make_flight(). This is quite normal, and it's a powerful aspect of Python's dynamic type system that allows us this very loose coupling between code. Let's go on and move Guido back to 15 with his fellow Europeans. It's important during booking to know how many seats are available. To this end, we'll write a num_available_seats method. This is achieved using two nested generator expressions. The outer expression filters for all rows, which are not None. This excludes our dummy first row. The value of each item in the outer expression is the sum of the number of None values in each row. This inner expression iterates over values of the dictionary and adds one for each None found. See how we split the outer expression over three lines to improve readability. (Typing) And just to check, let's do a little bit of math.\n",

      "OO With Function Objects\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we'll show how it's quite possible to write nice object-oriented code without needing classes. We have a requirement to produce boarding cards for our passengers in alphabetical order; however, we realize that the flight class is probably not a good home for details of printing boarding passes. We could go ahead and create a boarding card printer class, but that's probably overkill. Remember that functions are objects too and are perfectly sufficient for many cases. Don't feel compelled to make classes and objects without good reason. Rather than have a card printer query all the passenger details from the flight, we'll follow the object- oriented design principle of tell, don't ask, and have the flight tell a simple card printing function what to do. First, the card printer, which is just a module-level function. The new Python feature here is the use of line continuation backslash characters, which allow us to split a long statement over several lines. This is used together with implicit string concatenation of adjacent strings to produce one long string with no line breaks. We then measure the length of this output line, build some banners and borders around it, and then concatenate the lines together using the join method called on newline operator before printing the whole card followed by a blank line. Note that the card printer doesn't know anything about flights or aircraft. It's very loosely coupled. You can probably easily envisage an HTML card printer that has the same interface. To the flight class we add a new method, make_boarding_cards, which accepts the card_printer. This tells the card_printer to print each passenger having sorted a list of passenger seat tuples obtained from a _passenger_seats() implementation detail method. Note the leading underscore. That method is in fact a generator function which searches all seats for occupants yielding the passenger and the seat number as they are found. Now if we run this on the REPL we can see that the new boarding card print system works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymorphism and Duck Typing\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymorphism is a programing language feature which allows us to use objects of different types through a uniform interface. The concept of polymorphism applies to functions and more complex objects. We've just seen an example of polymorphism with the card printing example. The make_boarding_card method didn't need to know about an actual or as we say concrete card printing type, only the abstract details of its interface, essentially just the order of its arguments. Replacing our console card printer with the putative HTML card printer would exercise polymorphism. Polymorphism in Python is achieved through duck typing. Duck typing is in turn named after the duck test attributed to James William Riley the American poet. \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\" Duck typing where an object's fitness for a particular use is only determined at runtime is the cornerstone of Python's object system. This is in contrast to statically typed languages where a compiler determines if an object can be used. And in particular, it means that an object's suitability is not based on inheritance hierarchies, base classes, or anything except the attributes an object has at the time of use. Let's return to our aircraft class. The design of this class is somewhat flawed in that objects instantiated using it depend on being supplied with a seating configuration that matches the aircraft model, which for the purposes of this exercise we assumed is fixed per model. Better and simpler perhaps to get rid of the Aircraft class entirely and make separate classes for each specific model of aircraft with a fixed seating configuration. Here is an AirbusA319, and here's a Boeing777. These two aircraft classes have no explicit relationship to each other or to our original aircraft class beyond having identical interfaces to each other with the exception of the initializer, which now takes fewer arguments. As such, we can use these new types in place of each other. Let's change our make_flight() method into make_flights() to use them. The different types of aircraft work fine when used with flight because they both quack like ducks or fly like planes or something. Duck typing and polymorphism is very important in Python. In fact, it's the basis for the collection protocols we discussed such as iterator, iterable, and sequence.\n",

      "Inheritance and Implementation Sharing\n",
      "\n",
      "Inheritance is a mechanism whereby one class can be derived from a base-class allowing us to make behavior more specific in the sub-class. In nominally typed languages such as Java, class-based inheritance is the means by which runtime polymorphism is achieved. Not so in Python as we have just demonstrated. The fact that no Python method calls or attribute lookups are bound to actual objects until the point at which they are called known as late binding means we can attempt polymorphism with any object, and we'll succeed if the object fits. Although inheritance in Python can be used to facilitate polymorphism, after all derived classes will have the same interfaces as the base classes, inheritance in Python is most useful for sharing implementation between classes. As usual, this will make much more sense with an example. We would like our aircraft class's AirbusA319 and Boeing777 to provide a way of returning the total number of seats. We'll add a method called num_seats to both classes to do this. Unfortunately, we now have duplicate code across two classes, and as we add more aircraft types, the code duplication will worsen. The solution we look at here is to extract the common elements of AirbusA319 and Boeing777 into a base class from which both aircraft types will derive. Let's recreate the class Aircraft, this time with the goal of using it as a base class. It contains just the method we want to inherit into the derived classes. This class isn't usable on its own because it depends on a method called seating_plan, which isn't available at this level. Any attempt to use it standalone will fail. The class is abstract in so far as it is never useful to instantiate it alone. Now the derived classes. We specify inheritance in Python using parentheses containing the base class name immediately after the class name in the class statement. Here's the Airbus class, and this is the Boeing class. Let's exercise them at the REPL. We can see that both subtype aircraft inherited the num_seats() method, which now works as expected because the call to seating_plan is successfully resolved on the self object at runtime. Now that we have the base Aircraft class, we can hoist other common functionality into it. In this case, initializer and registration methods are identical between the two subtypes. Now the derived classes only contain the specifics for that aircraft type. All shared functionality is inherited from the base class. Thanks to duck typing, inheritance is less used in Python than in other languages. This is generally seen as a good thing because inheritance is a very tight coupling between classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Classes and inheritance are an important topic in Python, so let's sum up. All types in Python have a class. Classes define the structure and behavior of an object. The class is determined when an object is created and is fixed for the lifetime of the object in the general case. Classes are the key support for object-oriented programming in Python. Classes are defined using the class keyword followed by the class name, which is in CamelCase. Instances of a class are created by calling the class as if it were a function. Instance methods are functions defined inside the class, which should accept an object instance called self as the first parameter. Methods are called using the instance.method() syntax, which is syntactic sugar for passing the instance as the formal self argument to the method. An optional special initializer method called __init__() can be provided, which is used to configure the self object at creation time. If present, the constructor calls the __init__() method. Double underscore init is not the constructor. The object has been constructed by the time the initializer is called. Arguments passed to the constructor are forwarded to the initializer. Instance attributes are brought into existence simply by assigning to them. Attributes and methods which are implementation details are by convention prefixed with an underscore. There are no public, protected, or private access modifiers in Python. Access to implementation details from outside the class can be very useful during development, testing, and debugging. Class invariants should be established in the initializer. If the invariants can't be established, raise exceptions to signal failure. Methods can have docstrings, just like regular functions. Classes can have docstrings. Even within an object method, calls must be preceded with self. You can have as many classes and functions in a module as you wish. Related classes and global functions are generally grouped together this way. Polymorphism in Python is achieved through duck typing where attributes and methods are only resolved at point of use. This is called late binding. Polymorphism in Python does not require shared base classes or named interfaces. Class inheritance in Python is primarily useful for sharing implementation rather than being necessary for polymorphism. All methods are inherited including special methods like the initializer. Along the way we found that strings support slicing because they implement the sequence protocol. Following the Law of Demeter can reduce coupling. We can nest comprehensions. It can sometimes be useful to discard the current item in a comprehension using a dummy reference, conventionally the underscore character. When dealing with one-based collections, it's often easier just to waste one list entry. Don't feel compelled to use classes when a simple function will suffice. Functions are also objects. Complex comprehensions or generator expressions can be split over multiple lines to aid readability. Statements can be split over multiple lines using the backslash line continuation character. Use this feature sparingly and only when it improves readability. Object-oriented design where one object tells another information can be more loosely coupled than those where one object queries another. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next module.\n",

      "Files and Resource Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the ninth module of the Python Fundamentals course where we'll cover reading and writing data from text and binary files and discover how to manage resources such as files elegantly using context managers. To open a file in Python, we call the built-in open() function. This takes a number of arguments, but the most commonly used are: File, the path to the file. This is required. Mode, which specifies read/write/append, and binary or text mode. This is optional, but we always recommend specifying it for clarity. Explicit is better than implicit. Encoding. If the file contains encoded text data, this is the text encoding to use. It's often a good idea to specify this. If you don't specify it, Python will choose a default encoding for you, which may not be what you want. At the file system level, files contain only a series of bytes. Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in binary mode return and manipulate their contents as bytes objects without any decoding. Binary mode files reflect the raw data in the file. A file opened in text mode treats its contents as if it contains text strings of the str type, the raw bytes having first been decoded using a platform dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. By default, text mode also engages support for Python's universal newlines. This causes translation between a single portable newline character in our program strings, /n, and a platform-dependent newline representation in the raw bytes stored in the file system, for example carriage return newline /r/n on Windows. Getting the encoding right is crucial for correctly interpreting the contents of a text file, which is why we label the point. If you don't specify an encoding, Python will use the default from sys.getdefaultencoding. In our case, that's a UTF-8, but there's no guarantee that the default encoding on your system is the same as the default encoding on another system with which you wish to exchange files. Better for all concerned to make a conscious decision about the text bytes encoding. You can get a list of supported text encodings in the Python documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing Text Files\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start by writing some text to a file. We'll be explicit about using the UTF-8 encoding because we have no way of knowing what your default encoding is. We'll use keyword arguments to make things clearer still. The first argument is the filename wasteland.txt. The mode argument is a string containing letters with different meanings. In this case, W means write, and T means text. All mode strings should consist of a read, write, or append mode. One of R, W, or A with the optional plus modifier should be combined with a selective text or binary mode T or B. So, typical mode strings might be 'wb', write binary, or 'at', append text. Although both parts of the mode code support defaults, we recommend being explicit for the sake of readability. The exact type of the object returned by open depends on how the file was opened, dynamic typing in action. But for our purposes it's sufficient to know that the object returned is a file-like object, and as such we can expect it to support certain attributes and methods. We've shown previously how we can request help from modules and methods and types, but in fact we can request help on instances too. This makes sense when you remember that everything is an object. Browsing through the help we can see that F supports a method write. Quit the help with Q, and continue at the REPL. The write call returns the number of codepoints or characters written to the file. Let's write a few more lines. It is the caller's responsibility to provide newline characters where they are needed. There is no writeline method. (Typing) When we finish writing, we should remember to close the file by calling the close method, f.close(). Note that when we close the file all the contents become visible. Closing files is important. If you now exit the REPL and look in your file system on Unix with ls - l, you should see the wasteland.txt file with 78 bytes. On Windows with dir, you should see wasteland.txt with 79 bytes. This is because Python's universal newline behavior for files has translated the line endings to your system's native endings. The difference is because Python's universal newline behavior for files has translated the line endings to your platform's native endings. The number returned by the write method is the number of codepoints or characters in the string passed to write, not the number of bytes written to the file after encoding a universal newline translation. In general, when working with text files, you cannot sum the quantities returned by write to determine the length of the file in bytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading Text Files\n",
      "\n",
      "To read the file back, we use open again, but pass a different mode string, in this case 'rt' for read text. If we know how many bytes to read or if we want to read the whole file, we can use the read function. Looking back through our REPL, we can see that the first write was 32 characters long. We can read that back with a call to the read method. In text mode the read method accepts the number of characters to read from the file, not the number of bytes. The call returns the text and advances the file pointer to the end of what was read. The return type is str because we opened the file in text mode. To read all the remaining data in the file, we can call read without an argument. This gives us parts of two lines in one string. Note the newline character in the middle. At the end of the file, further calls to read return an empty string. Normally when we are finished reading a file we would close it, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll keep the file open and move the file pointer back to the beginning of the file using the seek method with a 0 offset from the start of the file. The return value is the new file pointer position. Using read for text is quite awkward, and thankfully Python provides us with better tools for reading text files line-by-line. First of these is the readline() function. The returned lines are terminated by a single newline character if there is one present in the file. The last line here does not terminate with a newline because there is no newline sequence at the end of the file. You shouldn't rely on the string returned by readline being terminated by a newline. Again, the universal newline support will have translated to /n from whatever the platform native newline sequence is. Once we reach the end of the file, further calls to readline return an empty string. Let's rewind again with seek. Sometimes when we know we want to read every line in the file and we're sure we have enough memory, we can read all lines into a list with the readlines() method. This is particularly useful if pausing the file involves hopping backwards and forwards between lines. It's much easier to do this with a list than with a file stream of characters. This time we'll close the file before moving on with g.close().\n",
      "\n",
      "Appending to Text Files\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we would like to append to an existing file. We can do that by opening the file with mode A, which opens the file for writing, appending to the end of the file if it already exists. In this example we combine that with T to be explicit about using text mode. Although there is no writeline method in Python, there is a writelines method, which writes an iterable series of strings to a stream. If you want line endings on your strings, you must provide them yourself. This seems odd at first, but it preserves symmetry with readlines whilst also giving us the flexibility of using writelines to write any iterable series of strings to a file. Notice that only three lines are completed in this example. I say completed because the file we're appending to doesn't end with a newline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Files as Iterators\n",
      "\n",
      "The culmination of these increasingly sophisticated text file reading tools is the fact that file objects support the iterator protocol with each iteration yielding the next line in the file. This means they can be used in for loops and any other place where an iterator can be used. At this point, we'll take the opportunity to create a Python module, files.py. We'll use this to contain the code for the following example. When run, this program opens the filename passes its command line argument, and iterates over the file with a for loop line-by-line printing each line as it goes. Let's run this program directly from the system command line passing the name of our text file wasteland.txt. The double line spacing occurs because each line of the poem is terminated by a newline, and then print adds its own. To fix that we could use the strip method to remove the whitespace from the end of each line prior to printing. Instead, we'll use the write method of the standard out stream. This is exactly the same write method used to write to the file. Files and streams are closely related and can be used because the stream is a file-like object. We can get hold of a reference to the standard out stream from the sys module. Rerunning, we now get single-space text. Now alas it's time to move on from one of the most important poems of the 20th century and get to grips with context managers.\n",

      "Managing Files With Try..Finally\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next demonstration, we're going to need a data file containing some numbers. We'll write a sequence of numbers called Recaman sequence to a text file with one number per line. Recaman sequence itself isn't important to this exercise. We just need a way of generating numeric data, so we won't be explaining the sequence generator. Feel free to experiment though. The module contains a generator for yielding the Recaman numbers and a function which writes the start of the sequence to a file using the writelines method. A generator expression is used to convert each number to a string and add a newline. Itertool's islice is used to truncate the otherwise infinite sequence. We'll write the first 1000 Recaman numbers to a file by executing the module passing the filename and series length as command line arguments. Now let's make a complimentary module, series.py, which reads this data file back in. This simply uses a for loop to iterate over the file reading one line at a time and strips the newline with a call to the strip string method and coverts it to an integer. Running it from the command line, everything works as expected. Now let's deliberately create an exceptional situation. Open Recaman.dat in a text editor and replace one of the numbers with something that isn't a stringified integer. Save the data file, and rerun series.py. The int constructor raises a ValueError, which is unhandled, so the program terminates with a stack trace. One problem here is that our f.close() call was never executed. To fix that, we can insert a try/finally block. Now the file will always be closed. Doing so opens up the opportunity for another refactoring. We can replace the for loop with a list comprehension and return the list directly. Even in this situation close will be called. The finally block is called; however, the try block is exited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context Managers and with-blocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to now, our examples have all followed a pattern. Open a file, work with the file, and close the file. The close is important, because it informs the underlying operating system that you're done working with a file. If you don't close a file when you're done with it, it's possible to lose data. There may be pending rights buffered up, which might not get written completely. Furthermore, if you're opening lots of files, your system may run out of resources. Since we always want to pair every open with a close, we want a mechanism that enforces that and makes sure it happens even if we forget. This need for resource cleanup is common enough that Python implements a specific control flow structure called with-block to support it. With-blocks can be used with any object which supports the context-manager protocol, and that includes the file objects returned by open(). Exploiting the context-manager nature of the file object and using a with-block, our read_series function can become very simple. We no longer need to call close explicitly because the with construct will call it for us when and by whatever means execution exits the block. Now we can go back and modify our Recaman series writing program to use a with-block too. This also removes the need for an explicit close.\n",

      "Simple Is Better Than Complex\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful is better than ugly. Sugary syntax, fewer defects attained through sweet fidelity. The with-block syntax is so-called syntactic sugar for a much more complex arrangement of try/except and try/finally blocks. Few of us would want our code to look this convoluted, but for it to be reliable this is how it would need to look without the with statement. Sugar may not be good for your health, but it can be very healthy for your code.\n",

      "Writing Binary Files\n",
      "\n",
      "To demonstrate handling of binary files, we need an interesting binary data format. The BMP file format contains device-independent bitmaps and is simple enough that we can make a BMP file writer from scratch in this session. The code will be placed in a module bmp.py and is straightforward from a file handling point of view. For simplicity sake, we have decided to deal with 8-bit grayscale images, which have the nice property that they are 1 byte per pixel. The write_grayscale function accepts two arguments, the filename and a collection of pixels. As the docstring points out, this collection should be a sequence of iterable series of integers. A list of lists of int objects will do just fine. Each int is a pixel value from 0 to 255. Each inner list is a row of pixels from left to right, and the outer list is a list of pixel rows from top to bottom. The first thing we do is figure out the size of the image by counting the number of rows to give the height and number of items in the 0th row to get the width. We assume, but don't check that all rows have the same length. In production code, that's a check we would want to make. Next we open the file for write in binary mode using the 'wb' mode string. We don't specify an encoding. That makes no sense for raw binary files. Inside the with-block we start writing what is called the BMP Header, which begins the BMP format. The header must start with a so-called magic byte sequence 'BM' to identify it as a BMP file. We use the write method, and because the file was opened in binary mode, we must pass a bytes object. The next four bytes should hold the 32-bit integer containing the file size, but we don't know that yet. We could've computed it in advance, but we'll take a different approach of writing a placeholder value for now, then returning to this point later to fill in the details. To be able to come back to this point, we use the tell method of the file object to give us the offset from the beginning of the file for the file pointer. We'll store this in a variable, which will act as a sort of bookmark. We write four 0 bytes as a placeholder using escaping syntax to specify the zeros. The next two pairs of bytes are unused in this format, so we'll just write 0 bytes for them too. The next four bytes are for another 32-bit integer, which should contain the offsetting bytes from the beginning of the file to the start of the pixel data. We don't know that value yet either, so we'll store another bookmark using tell and write another 4-byte placeholder. We'll return here shortly when we know more. The next section is called the Image Header. The first thing we have to do is write the length of the image header as a 32-bit integer. In our case, the header will always be 40 bytes long. We'll just hardwire that in hexadecimal. Notice that the BMP format is little-endian, the least significant byte is written first. The next 4 bytes are the image width as a little-endian 32-bit integer. We call a module scope implementation detail function here called _int32_to_bytes, which converts an int object into a bytes object containing exactly 4 bytes. We then use the same function again to deal with the image height. The remainder of the header is essentially fixed for 8-bit grayscale images, and the details aren't important here except to note that the whole header does in fact total 40 bytes. Each pixel in an 8-bit BMP image is an index into a color table with 256 entries. Each entry is a 4-byte blue, green, red color. For grayscale images, we need to write 256 four byte gray values on a linear scale. This snippet is fertile ground for experimentation, and a natural enhancement to this function would be to be able to supply this pallet separately as an argument to the function. At last we are ready to write the pixel data. But before we do, we make a note of the current file pointer offset using tell() as this is one of the locations we need to go back and fill in. Writing the pixel data is straightforward enough. We use the reversed built-in function to flip the order of the rows. BMP images are written from bottom to top. For each row, we simply pass the iterable series of integers to bytes constructor. If any of the integers are out of the range 0-255, the constructor will raise a ValueError. After the pixel data, we are at the end of the file. We undertook to record this offset value earlier, so we record the precision using tell() into an end of file bookmark variable. Now we can rewind and fulfill our promises by replacing the placeholder offsets we recorded with the real thing. To do this, we seek back to the size_bookmark we remembered back near the beginning of the file and write to the size stored in the eof_bookmark as a little-endian 32-bit integer using our _int32_to_bytes function. Finally, we seek to the pixel data offset placeholder bookmarked by pixel_offset_bookmark and write the 32-bit integer stored in pixel_data_bookmark. As we exit the with-block, we can rest assured that the context manager will close the file and commit any buffered writes to the file system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitwise Operators\n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with binary files often requires pulling apart or assembling data at the byte level. This is exactly what our _int32_to_bytes function is doing. We'll take a quick look at it because it shows some features of Python we haven't seen before. The function uses the bitwise shift and bitwise and operators to extract individual bytes from the integer value. Notice that bitwise and uses the ampersand symbol to distinguish it from the logical and, which is the spelled out word. The double arrow is the right shift operator, which shifts the binary representation of the integer right by the specified number of bits. The routine shifts the integer 1, 2, and 3 bytes to the right before extracting the least significant byte with the bitwise and at each position. The four resulting integers are used to construct a tuple, which is then passed to the bytes constructor to produce a 4-byte sequence.\n",

      "In order to generate a BMP image file, we're going to need some pixel data. We've provided a simple module, fractal.py, which produces pixel values for the iconic Mandelbrot set fractal. We're not going to explain the fractal generation code in detail, and still less the math behind it, but the code is simple enough and doesn't rely on any Python features we haven't encountered already. The key takeaway is that the Mandelbrot function uses nested list comprehensions to produce a list of lists of integers in the range 0-255 representing an image of the fractal. The integer value of each point is produced by the mandel function. Let's fire up the REPL and use the fractal and BMP modules together. First we use the Mandelbrot function to produce an image of 448 x 256 pixels. You'll get best results using images with an aspect ration of about 7:4. This last call may take a second or so. Our fractal generator is simple rather than efficient. We can take a look at the return data structure, a list of lists of integers just as we were promised. Let's write those pixel values to a BMP file. Find the file, and open it in an image viewer, for example by opening it in your web browser.\n",

      "We're not going to write a full-blown BMP reader, although that would be an interesting exercise. We'll just make a simple function to determine the image dimension and pixels from a BMP file. We'll add the code into bmp.py. Of course we use a with statement to manage the file so we don't have to worry about it being properly closed. Inside the with-block we perform a simple validation check by looking at the first two magic bytes that we expect in a bmp file. If they're not present, we raise a ValueError, which will of course cause the context manager to close the file. Looking back at our BMP writer we can determine that the image dimensions are stored exactly 18 bytes from the beginning of the file. We seek to that location and use the read method to read two chunks of 4 bytes each for the two 32-bit integers, which represent the dimensions. Because we opened the file in binary mode, read returns a bytes object. We pass each of these two bytes objects to another implementation detail method _bytes_to_int32, which assembles them back into an integer. The two integers representing image width and height are returned as a tuple. The _bytes_to_int32 function uses bitwise left shift and bitwise all, which is the vertical bar or the pipe symbol together with indexing of the bytes object to reassemble the integer. Notice that indexing into a bytes object returns an integer. Let's try our new BMP dimensions function on the mandel.bmp file.\n",

      "File Like Objects\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a notion in Python of file-like objects. This isn't as formal as a specific protocol like sequence protocol is for tuple objects, but thanks to the polymorphism afforded by duck typing it works well in practice. This is where the easier to ask forgiveness than permission philosophy comes into its own. If you want to perform seek on a file-like object without knowing in advance that it supports random access, go ahead and try literally, but be prepared to fail if the seek method doesn't exit or does exist, but doesn't behave as you expect. You might say if it looks like a file and reads like a file, then it is a file. We've actually seen this already. The objects returned to us when we opened files in text and binary mode are actually of different types, although both with definitely file-like behavior. We saw one of them in action back at the beginning of the course used to retrieve data from a URL on the internet. Let's exploit this polymorphism across file-like objects by writing a function to count to the number of words per line in a file and return that information as a list. Now we'll open a regular text file containing the fragment of T.S. Eliot's masterpiece we created earlier and pass it to our new function. The actual type of real_file is _io.TextIOWrapper, which is an internal Python implementation detail. We'll now do the same using a file-like object representing a web resource referred to by a URL. (Typing) In this example, the type of web file is http.client.HTTPReponse, a quite different thing. However, since they are both file-like objects, our function can work with both. There's nothing magical about file-like objects. It's just a convenient and fairly informal description for a set of expectations we can place on an object, which are exploited through duck typing.\n",

      "Closing With Context Managers\n",
      "\n",
      "The with statement construct can be used with any type of object which implements the context-manager protocol. We're not going to show you how to implement that in this course, but we will show you a simple way to make your own classes useable with a context manager using the code in fridge.py. The module includes a class RefrigeratorRaider, which well raids the refrigerator. It has three methods: Open, which opens the fridge door; take, which gets some food from the refrigerator; and close, which closes the fridge door. There's also a module scope driver function raid, which performs a full raid on the refrigerator. We'll import raid into the REPL and go on the rampage. First, let's take some bacon. As expected, the code opens the fridge doors, finds the bacon, takes the bacon, and closes the fridge door. Very responsible. It's important that we remember to close the door so the food will be preserved until our next raid. Now let's try another raid for deep fried pizza. This time we were interrupted by the health warning and didn't get around to closing the door. We can fix that by using a function called closing in the Python Standard Library contextlib module. After importing the function, we wrap our call to the RefrigeratorRaider constructor in a call to the closing function, which wraps our object in a context manager that always calls the close() method on the wrapped object before exiting. We use this object to initialize the with-block. Now when we execute a raid the fridge door is closed twice. We see that our explicit call to close in unnecessary, so let's fix that up too. A more sophisticated implementation might check that the door was already closed and ignore subsequent requests. Let's try again. This time, even though the health warning was triggered, the door was still closed for us afterwards by the context manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's summarize what we've covered in this module. Files are opened using the built-in open() function, which accepts a file mode. This controls read/write/append behavior and also whether the file is treated as binary or encoded text data. For text data, it's good practice to always specify an encoding. Text files differ from binary files by dealing with string objects and performing universal newline translation and string encoding. Binary files deal with bytes objects with no newline translation or encoding. When you write text files, it's up to us to provide newline characters for line breaks. Files should always be closed after use to prevent resource leaks and to ensure that all data has been committed to the file system. Files provide various convenient methods for working with lines, but are also iterators, which yield values line-by-line. Files are also context mangers and can be used with the with-statement. This ensures that cleanup operations such as closing the files are performed. The notion of file-like objects is loosely defined, but very useful in practice. Exercise easier to ask forgiveness than permission to make the most of them. Context managers aren't restricted to file-like objects. We can use the tools in the contextlib standard library module such as the closing() wrapper to create our own context managers. Along the way in this module we found that help() can be used on instance objects, not just types, and Python supports bitwise operators bitwise &, bitwise or, and left- and right-bitwise shifts. We've given you some powerful tools in this module for getting data into and out of your programs. Next time we'll look at how to make your programs correct with debuggers, reliable with unit testing, and deployable to other computers and people with packaging. Thanks for watching, and we hope to see you in the next and last module.\n",

      "Introduction and unittest\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, my name is Austin Bingham. Welcome to the 10th module of the Python Fundamentals course. Here, we'll cover some topics related to producing working maintainable code in Python. We'll look at the unittest module which you can use to automate testing of your code and we'll look at the debugger that comes with standard library. After that, we'll briefly cover the basics of packaging and distributing your code as well as how to install third party packages. When we build programs at even minor complexity, there are countless ways for defects to creep into our code. This can happen when we initially write the code but we're just as likely to introduce defects when we're making modifications to it. To help get a handle on defects and keep our code quality high, it's often very useful to have a set of tests that you can run which will tell you if you code is acting as you expect it to. To help with this, the Python standard library includes the unittest module. Despite its name, this module provides a flexible framework for automating tests of all sorts from acceptance tests to integration tests to unit tests. Its key feature, like many testing framework in many languages, is that it makes automated and repeatable tests. Meaning that you can cheaply and easily verify your code at any time. The unittest module is built around a handful of key concepts. At the center of these concepts is a notion of a TestCase which groups together a set of related individual test functions. A TestCase is the basic unit of test organization in the unittest framework. The next important concepts is that of fixtures. Fixtures are pieces of code which run before and/or after every test method. Fixtures are used to make sure that the test environment is in an expected state before a test is run. For example, to create a necessary database table or populate a cache. Fixtures are then used to clean up any resources that may have been used in a test method. The final key concept is that of assertions. Assertions are how you can tell the unittest framework to make specific checks which determine whether a test passes or fails. Among other things, assertions can make simple Boolean checks, perform object equality tests, or verify that the proper exceptions are thrown. If an assertion fails, then a test function fails. So assertions are really the lowest level of testing you can perform. With those concepts in mind, let's see how to actually use the unittest module. For this, we'll use test-driven development to write a simple text analysis function. This function will take in a filename, read the file, and calculate both the number of lines in the file and the number of characters in the file. Since this will be an iterative development process, we'll put the code in the file text_analyzer.py rather than work at the REPL. So to start, let's create our first test with enough supporting code to actually run it. First, we import the unittest module. Next, we create our test case by creating a class, TextAnalysisTests which derives from unittest.TestCase. This is how you create test cases with the unittest framework. To define individual test methods in a test case, you simply create methods to start with test_. These are automatically discovered by the unittest framework and don't require any sort of explicit registration. In this case, we define the simplest possible test. Does the analyze_text function run at all? This function doesn't make any explicit checks, but rather relies on the fact that a test method will fail if it throws any exceptions. In this case, if analyze_text isn't defined, then this test will fail. Finally, we define the idiomatic main block which calls unittest.main when this module is executed. unittest.main will search for all TestCase subclasses in a module and execute all of their test methods. Since we're using test-driven design here, we expect our test to fail at first, and indeed, this fails spectacularly for the simple reason that we haven't defined the necessary function yet. unittest.main produces a simple report telling us how many tests run and how many failed. It also shows us how the test failed. In this case, it's showing us that we got a NameError when we tried to run the non-existent function analyze_text. Let's fix that by adding the function. Remember that in test-driven development, we only write enough code to satisfy our tests, so all we do now is create an empty function. Running the test again, we find that we now pass. The next thing you want to do is to be able to pass a filename to analyze_text so that it knows what to process. For this to make sense, we want the filename to represent an actual file. To make sure that a file exists, we're going to define some fixtures. The first fixture we can define is a method on the TestCase called setUp. This function is run before each test method. In this case, we'll use setUp to create a file for us and remember the filename as a member of the TestCase. The second fixture available to us is another TestCase method called tearDown. tearDown is run after each test method. And in this case, we're going to use it to delete the file we created in setUp. Since we're using the os module in tearDown, we need to import it at the top of the file. Notice how tearDown swallows any exceptions thrown by os.remove. We do this because tearDown can't actually be certain that the file exists, so it simply tries to remove the file and it assumes that any failure is acceptable. With our two fixtures in place, we now have a file that is created before each test method and we just delete it after each test method. This means that each test method is starting in a stable known state. This is critical to making reproducible tests. You may have noticed that the setUp and tearDown function names aren't inline with what PEP 8 prescribes. This is because the unittest module predates those parts of PEP 8 which specify the convention of function names being in lowercase with underscores. There are several such cases in the Python standard library but most new Python code follows the PEP 8 style. Now that we have a finalname that we can pass to analyze_text, let's pass it in by modifying our existing test. Since the self argument passed to the fixture is the same instance as that passed to the test method, our test can access the filename attribute created in setUp. Of course, this test fails because analyze_text doesn't accept any arguments yet. That's simple enough to fix. Now we're passing again. Now that we're satisfied that the function exists and accepts the right number of arguments, let's see if we can make it do real work. The first thing we want is for the function to return the number of lines in the file, so let's define that test. Here, we see our first example of an assertion. The TestCase class has many assertion methods and in this case, we use assertEqual to check that the number of lines counted by our function is equal to four. If the value returned by analyze_text is not equal to four, this assertion will cause the test method to fail. And that is precisely what happens. We can now see that we're running two tests, that one of them passes and the new one fails with an AssertionError. Let's break from the TDD rules and move a bit faster now. First, we'll update the function to return the number of lines in the file. This gives good results. So let's add a test for the other feature we want which is to count the number of characters in the file. Since the function is now supposed to return two values, we'll have it return a tuple with a line count in the first position and character count in the second. Our new test looks like this. And it fails as expected. This tells us that it can't index into the integer returned by analyze_text. So let's fix analyze_text to return the proper tuple. This fixes our new test, but we find we've broken an old one. But that's easy enough to fix because all we need to do is account for the new return type. Now, everything is passing again. Another thing we want to test for is that analyze_text throws the correct exception when it is passed a non-existent filename. Here we see the use of assertRaises assertion. This assertion checks that the specified exception type, in this case, IOError, is thrown from the body of the with block. Since open raises IOError for nonexistent files, our test already passes. Finally, we can see one more very useful type of assertion if we write a test to verify that analyze_text doesn't delete the file, a reasonable requirement for the function. assertTrue simply checks that the value passed into it evaluates to true. There's an equivalent assertFalse which does the same thing but for false values. As you might imagine, this test passes already as well. So now we've got a useful passing set of tests. This example is small but it demonstrates many of the important parts of the unittest module. There are many more parts of unittest but you can get quite far using just the techniques we've seen here.\n",

      "Debugging With PDB\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the comprehensive automated test suite, we can still get into situations where we need a debugger to figure out what's going on. Fortunately, Python includes a powerful debugger with the standard library, PDB. PDB is a command line debugger and if you're familiar with tools like GDB, then you already have a good idea of how to use PDB. PDB is different from many debugging tools in that it's not really a separate program but a module just like any other Python module. You can import PDB into any program and start the debugger using the set_trace function call. This function simply starts the debugger at whatever point you are at in the program's execution. For our first look at PDB, let's use a REPL and start the debugger with set_trace. You'll see that even after you execute set_trace, your prompt changes from the triple chevron to Pdb in parenthesis. This is how you know you're in the debugger. The first thing we'll do is simply see what commands are available in the debugger by typing help. This lists a few dozen commands and some of which you'll use in almost every debugging session and some of which you may never use at all. You can get specific help on a command by typing help followed by the command name. For example, to see what continue does, type help continue. The curious parenthesis in the commands tell you that continue can be activated by typing c, C-O-N-T or the full word continue. Knowing the shortcuts for common PDB commands can greatly increase your comfort and speed at debugging. Rather than simply list all the commonly useful PDB commands, we're going to instead debug a simple function. Our function, is_palindrome, takes in an integer and determines if the digits of the integer are a palindrome or not. A palindrome of course is a sequence which is the same both forwards and backwards. The first thing we'll do is create a new file, palindrome.py, with this code. As you can see, our code has three main parts. The first is the digits function which converts an integer into a list of digits. The second is the is_palindrome function which first calls digits and then checks if the resulting list is a palindrome. The third part is a set of unit tests. We'll use these tests to drive the program. As you might expect, since this is a section on debugging, there's a bug in this code. We're going to first run the program and notice the bug, and then we'll see how to use PDB to find the bug. So, let's simply run the program. We have three tests that we expect to run, and since this is a relatively simple program, we expect it to run very quickly. Instead of running quickly, we see that this program seems to run forever. If you look at its memory usage, you'll also see that it grows in size the longer it runs. Clearly, something is wrong. So let's use Control + C to kill the program. We'll now use PDB to try to understand what's going on here. Since we don't know where our problem might lie, we don't know where to put a set_trace call so we're going to instead start the program under the control of the PDB using a command line invocation. Here, we're using the -m argument which tells Python to execute this specific module, in this case, pdb, as a script. The remaining arguments are passed to that script. Here, we're telling Python to execute the pdb module as a script and we're passing the name of our broken file to it. What we're seeing is that we're immediately taken to a Pdb prompt. The arrow pointing to import unittest is telling us that this is the next instruction that will be executed when we continue. But where is that instruction? Let's use the where command to find out. Where reports are current call stack with the most recent frames at the bottom. And we can see that PDB has paused execution at the very first line of palindrome.py. This reinforces an important aspect of Python execution which we've discussed before. Everything is evaluated at run time. In this case, we pause execution right before an import statement. We can execute this import by running to the next statement using the next command. We see that this takes us to the def call for the digits function. When we execute another next, we move to the definition of the is_palindrome function. You may be wondering why the debugger didn't step into the body of digits. After all, isn't it evaluated at run time like everything else? The answer is that the body of the function can only be evaluated when there are arguments supplied to it. So we will only be run when the function is called. The body of functions are checked for proper syntax when they're imported, but PDB doesn't let us debug that part of the process. We could continue using next to move through our program's execution, but since we don't know where the bug lies, this might not be a very useful technique. Instead, remember that the problem with our program is that it seemed to be running forever. This sounds a lot like an infinite loop. So rather than stepping through our code, we'll simply let it execute and then we'll use Control + C to break back into the debugger when we think it might be in that loop. After letting the program run for a few seconds, we press Control + C which halts the program and shows us that we're in the digits function of palindrome.py. If we want to see the source code at that line, we can use the PDB command list. We see that this is indeed inside a loop which confirms our suspicion that an infinite loop might be involved. We can use the return command to try to run to the end of the current function. If this doesn't return, we'll have very strong evidence that this is an infinite loop. We let this run for a few seconds to confirm that we never exit the function and then we press Control + C. Once we get back to our PDB prompt, let's exit PDB with the quit command. Since we know the problem lies in digits, let's set an explicit breakpoint in there using the pdb.set_trace function mentioned earlier. Remember that the set_trace function will halt execution and enter the debugger. Now we can just execute our script without specifying the PDB module. And we see that we almost immediately go to a PDB prompt with execution halted at the beginning of our digits function. To verify that we know where we are, let's use where to see our call stack. Remember that the most recent frames are at the end of this listing. After a lot of unittest functions, we see that we are indeed in the digits function and that it was called by is_palindrome just as we expected. What we want to do now is watch execution and see why we never exit the function's loop. Let's use next to move to the first line of the loop body. Now let's look at the value of some of our variables and try to decide what we expect to happen. We can examine values by using the print command. This looks correct. The digs list which will contain the sequence of digits in the end is empty, and x is what we passed in. We expect the divmod function to return 123 and 4, so let's try that. This looks correct, divmod has clipped off the least significant digit from our number. The next line puts that digit into our results list. If we look at digs, we'll see that it now contains mod. The next line will now update x so that we can continue clipping digits from it. We see that execution goes back up to the while loop as we expected. Let's look at x to make sure it has the right value. Wait a second. We expect x to hold the digits that aren't already in the results list. Instead, it contains only the digit in the results list. Clearly, we've made a mistake in updating x. If we look at our code, it quickly becomes apparent that we should have assigned div rather than mod to x. Let's exit PDB. Note that you may have to run quit a few times because of how PDB and unittest interact. After you're out of PDB, let's remove the set_trace call and modify digits to fix the problem we found. If we run our program now, we see that we're passing all tests and it runs very quickly. That's a basic PDB session and it demonstrates some of the core features of PDB. PDB has many other commands and features, however, and the best way to learn them is to simply start using PDB and trying out the commands. This palindrome program can serve as a good example for learning most of the features of PDB.\n",

      "Virtual Environments\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we move on to the next sections, we'll need to quickly look at how to create virtual environments for Python. A virtual environment is a light-weight, self-contained Python installation that users can create without needing administrator rights on their system. If you're using Python 3.3 or later, then you should already have a module called venv installed with the standard library. You can verify this by running this from the command line. If you don't have venv installed, there is another tool, virtualenv that you can get from the Python Package Index which works very similarly. You can use either venv or virtualenv for this course, but we'll be using venv in the examples. Using the venv module is very simple. You simply specify the directory to contain your new virtual environment. The tool creates the new directory and populates it with the installation. Once the environment is created, you can activate it by using the activate script in the environment bin directory. On Linux or Mac OS, you have to source the script. On Windows, you simply run it. Once you do this, your prompt will change to remind you that you are in a virtual environment. And most importantly, the Python that will execute when you run Python is from the virtual environment. To leave the virtual environment, you use the deactivate command. This will return you to the parent shelf from which the virtual environment was activated. We'll be using virtual environments in the following sections, so make sure that you can create them before moving on.\n",

      "Distributing Your Programs\n",
      "\n",
      "Packaging and distributing your Python code can be a complex and sometimes confusing task, especially if your projects have lots of dependencies or involved components more exotic than straight Python code. However for many cases, it's very straightforward to make your code accessible to others in a standard way. We'll see how to do that using the standard distutils module in this section. The distutils modules allows you to write a simple Python script which knows how to install your Python modules into any Python installation. By convention, this script is called setup.py and it exists at the top of your project structure. This script can then be executed to perform the actual installation. Let's see a simple example of distutils. We'll create a basic setup.py installation script for the palindrome module we wrote in the previous section. The first thing we want to do is to create a directory to hold our project. Let's call this palindrome. Let's put a copy of our palindrome.py in this directory. Finally, let's create our setup.py. The first line in the file imports the functionality we need from the distutils.core module namely the setup function. This function does all of the work of installing our code, so we need to tell it about the code we're installing. We do this of course with the arguments we pass to the function. The first thing we tell setup is the name of the project. We've chosen palindrome in this case, but you can choose any name you like. In general though, it's simplest to just keep the name the same as your project name. The next argument we pass to setup is the version. Again, this can be any string you want. Python doesn't rely on the version to follow any rules. The next argument, py_modules, is probably the most interesting. We use this to specify the Python modules we want to install. Each entry in this list is the name of the module without the .py extension. setup will look for the matching .py file and install it. So in our example, we've asked setup to install palindrome.py which of course is a file in our project. The rest of the arguments we're using here are fairly self-explanatory and are there mostly to help people to use your module correctly and to know who to contact if they have problems. Before we start using our setup.py, we first need to create a virtual environment into which we'll install our module. In your palindrome directory, create a virtual environment called palindrome_env. When this completes, activate the new environment. On Linux or Mac OS, source the activate script. On Windows, call the script directly. Now that we've got our setup.py, we can use it to do a number of interesting things. The first and perhaps most obvious thing we can do is install our module into our virtual environment. We do this by passing the install argument to setup.py. setup prints out a few lines to tell you about its progress. The most important line for us is where it actually copies palindrome.py to the installation folder. The site-packages directory of a Python installation is where third party packages such as ours are normally installed. So it looks like the installation worked properly. Let's verify this by running Python and seeing that our module can be imported. Note that we want to change directories before we do this. Otherwise, when we import palindrome, Python will simply load the source file in our current directory. Here, we use the file attribute on the module to see where it was imported from, and see that we're importing it from our virtual environment's site-packages which is exactly what we wanted. Don't forget to switch back to your source directory after exiting the Python REPL. Another useful feature of setup is that it can create various types of distribution formats. It will take all of the modules you specified and bundle them up into packages that are easy to distribute to others. You can do this with the sdist command which is shorthand for source distribution. If we look, we'll see that this command created a new directory dist which contains the newly generated distribution file. If we unzip that file, we'll see that it contains our project's source code including the setup.py. So now you can send this zip file to anyone who wants to use your code, and they can use the setup.py to install it into their system, very convenient. Note that the sdist command can produce distributions of various types. To see the available options, you can use the --help-formats option. This section really just touches on the very basic of distutils. You could find out more about how to use distutils by passing --help to setup.py. For most simple projects, however, you'll find that what we've just covered is almost all you need to know.\n",

      "\n",
      "Packaging in Python has a troubled and confusing history. Thankfully, the situation has settled down and the tool called pip has emerged as the clear winner among package installation tools for general purpose Python use. For more specialist uses such as numerical or scientific computing which rely on the NumPy or SciPy packages, you should consider Anaconda as a strong alternative to pip. In this section, we'll focus on pip as it is officially blessed by the core Python developers and comes with support out of the box. The pip tool is included and installed with Python since version 3.4. For older versions of Python 3, you'll need to look up specific instructions on how to install pip for your platform as you may need to use your operating system's package manager depending on how you originally installed Python. The best place to start is the Python package user guide. The pip tool can search for packages in the central repository. The Python Package Index or PyPI also known by the nickname CheeseShop and then download and install them along with their dependencies. You can browse the PyPI at pypi.python.org/pypi. This is an extremely convenient way to install Python software so it's good to understand how to use it. We'll demonstrate how to use pip by installing the nose testing tool. nose is a sort of power tool for running unittest based tests such as those we developed at the beginning of this module. One really useful thing it can do is discover all of your tests and run them. This means that you don't need to add unittest.main into your code. You can just use nose to find and run your tests. First though, we need to do some groundwork. Let's create a virtual environment so we don't inadvertently install nose into our system Python installation. Create a virtual environment using venv and activate it. As pip is updated much more frequently than Python itself, it's good practice to upgrade pip in any new virtual environment, so let's do that. Fortunately, pip is capable of updating itself with pip install --upgrade pip. If you don't upgrade pip, it will give you warnings everything you use it if a new version has come available since you last upgraded. Now let's use pip to install nose. The pip tool uses subcommands to decide what to do. To install modules, you use pip install package name. If this succeeds, nose is ready to use in our virtual environment. Let's check that it's available by trying to import it at the REPL and introspecting the path at which it was installed. As well as installing a module, nose installs the nosetests program in the bin directory of the virtual environment. To really put the icing on the cake, let's use nosetests to run the test from the palindrome.py script we were working with earlier by changing into the palindrome project directory and passing the palindrome.py source file as the only argument to the nosetests program. You can also use pip to install for local packages and files rather than from the Python Package Index. To do this, pass the filename of the package distribution to pip install. Earlier, we showed how to build the source distribution of palindrome using distutils. To install this source distribution in our test environment using pip, do pip install palindrome-1.0.zip. A key advantage to installing packages with pip rather than directly invoking the setup.py of the source distribution is that pip knows how to uninstall packages. To do so, use the uninstall subcommand, passing the name of the package you used at the time it was installed. So in this case, invoke pip uninstall palindrome-1.0.zip.\n",

      "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. To guess is to know that you have left something out. What are you missing? Temptation to guess or to ignore ambiguity with wishful thinking can lead to short-term gains, but it can often lead to confusion in the future and bugs which are difficult to understand and fix. Before you make that next quick fix, ask yourself what information do you need to do it correctly?\n",

      "We've really come full circle in this module. We started by learning how to develop automated tests using unittest. We then learned how to debug our code with PDB followed by sections on packaging and distributing our code with distutils and we finished off by learning how to install third party code into our Python installations. One of the programs we were able to install in the end was a tool to help us run the tests we developed earlier. That's quite a trip. Here's a more detailed list of the topics we covered. The unittest module is a framework for developing reliable automated tests. You define test cases by subclassing from unitttest.TestCase. The unittest.main function is useful for running all of the tests in a module. The setUp and tearDown fixtures are used to run code before and after each test method. Test methods are defined by creating method names that start with test_ on test case objects. The various TestCase.assert methods can be used to make a test method fail when the right conditions aren't met. Use TestCase.assertRaises in a with statement to check that the right exceptions are thrown in the test. Python standard debugger is called PDB. PDB is a command line debugger. The PDB.set_trace method can be used to stop program execution and enter the debugger. Your REPL's prompt will change to Pdb in parenthesis when you're in the debugger. You can access PDB's built-in help system by typing help. You can use python -m pdb followed by a script name to run a program under PDB from the start. PDB's where command shows the current call stack. PDB's next command lets execution continue to the next line of code. PDB's continue command lets program execution continue indefinitely, or until you stop it with Control + C. PDB's list command shows you the source code at your current location. PDB's return command resumes execution until the end of the current function. PDB's print command lets you see the value of objects in the debugger. Use quit to exit PDB. Virtual environments are light-weight, self-contained Python installations that any user can create. venv is the standard tool for creating virtual environments. venv accepts both a source-installation argument as well as a directory name into which it creates the new environment. To use a virtual environment, you need to run its activate script. When you activate a virtual environment, the prompt is modified to remind you. The distutils package is used to help you distribute your Python code. distutils is generally used inside a setup.py script which users run to install your software. The main function in distutil is setup. setup takes a number of arguments describing both the source files as well as metadata for the code. The most common way to use setup.py is to install code using python setup.py install. setup.py can also be used to generate distributions of your code. Distributions can be zip files, tarballs, or several other formats. Pass --help to setup.py to see all of its options. Common tools for installing third party software are distutils and pip. The central repository for Python packages is the Python Package Index also called PyPI or cheeseshop. To install modules with pip, use the subcommand notation pip install package-name. Along the way, we found that divmod calculates the quotient and remainder for division operation at one time. The reversed function can reverse a sequence. You can pass -m to your Python command to have it run a module as a script. Debugging makes it clear that Python is evaluating everything at run time. You can use the __file attribute on a module to find out where its source file is located. Third party Python packages are generally installed into your installation's site-packages directory. nose is a useful tool for working with unittest based tests. Well done on completing our Python Fundamentals course. We hope we've given you a firm foothold on the start of your journey with Python. The knowledge we impart in this course is sufficient to create and maintain basic Python programs. But there's so much more to learn. Python is a large and complicated language with many moving parts. While we find it remarkable that much of this complexity is well hidden for much of the time, the moment will soon arrive when you need to deepen your Python language skills. Recall that this Python Fundamentals course is the first in our trilogy covering the core Python language and standard library. From here, you can proceed directly to our Python - Beyond the Basics course. Then, onwards again to the lofty heights of Advanced Python. If you like written materials to go along with this course, remember to check out our Python Craftsman book series. The book correspond to our Pluralsight courses which cover the core Python language. The first book in the Craftsman series, The Python Apprentice, corresponds to this Python Fundamentals Pluralsight course. The second book, The Python Journeyman, corresponds to our Python - Beyond the Basics Pluralsight course. The trilogy is completed by The Python Master which corresponds to our Advanced Python course. Pluralsight viewers can follow the URLs shown below each book to get them at a deep discount. In addition to the courses and books just mentioned, we'll doubtlessly back with more content for the ever growing Python language and library. Please remember though that the most important characteristic of Python, it's great fun to write Python software, so enjoy yourselves.\n",
